therefore , i call on the commission to transpose what is agreed in nagoya into proposals that can be measured and monitored and to develop a long - term vision , so that , in 2011 , we do not need to say once  |||  again  |||  that we have been unable to halt biodiversity loss .

american views of the muslim world are so colored by the conflict in the middle east and the wars in iraq and  |||  afghanistan  |||  that us citizens have no collective appreciation of the fact that most muslims live in asia . or that the four countries with the largest muslim populations -- indonesia , pakistan , india , and bangladesh -- are all cultures with millennia - old histories of coexisting with other religions and cultures .
much of this progress was  |||  achieved  |||  during the cold war , proving that it is possible to create global legal norms even in times of deep political division .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to congratulate the committee chair , brian simpson , for leading the work of the committee and work on the file , and , above all , for having  |||  allowed  |||  its conclusion - at least i hope so because the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) will be voting for this - and approval on first reading , and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation .
the fund establishes the possibility of granting aid to those  |||  affected  |||  by natural disasters that cause considerable damage .
monitoring of the use of external experts by the  |||  agencies  |||  must be enabled .
they , too , had a good deal of positive input to offer and we were only a couple of small unresolved issues away from reaching an  |||  agreement  |||  at first reading , although it is , in any case , that bit more democratic to have a vote in the house first .
the fact that it has been  |||  adopted  |||  by a large majority confirms the importance given to improving the use of european funds .
on that point , i  |||  agree  |||  with the previous speaker .
in writing . - ( pt ) this proposal should be in line with the reasons behind the 6th environment  |||  action  |||  programme with the aim of applying current knowledge of prospective and retrospective strategies for assessing the risks and dangers to humans and the environment and to create coherency with other policies .

in particular , the need for better coordination between the different member states , the necessary improvement of the quality of the information that is exchanged , the need to allow other member states automated  |||  access  |||  to certain data contained in member states ' databases and the requirement to harmonise registration and deregistration procedures are ideas that are strongly supported by the commission .
i voted for this resolution on the european union 's strategy for the copenhagen summit on climate change as i am convinced that a comprehensive international  |||  agreement  |||  can actually alter the trend of uncontrolled growth in greenhouse gas emissions .
this is currently a subject of disagreement , and we would insist most emphatically that half - measures and relaxed criteria should not be  |||  agreed  |||  to , in view of either crises or normal human error .
therefore , i think it is absolutely vital that all members of this parliament urge the commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that i mean proposals which would  |||  allow  |||  every region across europe that qualifies , to access structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future .

disparities in health between countries , between regions , between rich and poor , between different ethnic minorities ,  |||  affect  |||  each and every eu member state and , in many places , they are getting wider .

it is important to me that these cultural driving forces have optimum  |||  access  |||  to the new digital and audiovisual formats .

today , the european parliament  |||  adopted  |||  an historic and particularly important directive strengthening the fight against trafficking in human beings .
the latter is fully taken into account in our common efforts to design an improved ets , and the position of those industries will certainly be considered in the context of any international  |||  agreement  |||  that is negotiated and the implications for european industries , particularly energy - intensive ones , if we do not create the level playing field that we are seeking through negotiation .
it means that next year , if the growth figures collapse again , we will stand up in front of everyone and have no  |||  answer  |||  to the economic situation .
the  |||  amendment  |||  to directive 2001/83 / ec emphasises better information for patients , especially in relation to the distinction between information and advertising .

that is why , madam president , i wish to conclude with two final points : it is important never to forget that energy efficiency is also  |||  achieved  |||  , to a large extent , by cutting energy use through microgeneration projects like those included in this report ; and , finally , it was a great victory for this house to ensure that the amount of financing to be allocated to these projects would be specified .
without calling into question the importance of the work done by the acp - eu joint parliamentary assembly ( jpa ) in 2009 or its undeniable contribution to development cooperation , i cannot fail to express my concern about the content of point 6 of the joly report : ' encourages the jpa to continue to work on this area and to explore  |||  additional  |||  and innovative sources of financing for development , such as an international financial transaction tax ' .
many warlords are indeed carrying on their struggle , often with foreign ( and even  |||  american  |||  ) backing .
this  |||  allowed  |||  the european union financial sector to invest most profitably in those countries .
these are included among the most vulnerable groups such as the disabled , elderly and children , not taking into  |||  account  |||  the fact that many migrants are illegal , and have therefore arrived in europe improperly .
that is how he led  |||  america  |||  in the wrong direction .
once  |||  again  |||  i maintain at this point that everything which the commission has said to date in this regard is disproved in the current negotiations of the trialogue on the climate package .

in view of recent developments in the situation and by  |||  agreement  |||  with the political groups , i would like to propose the following changes to the order of business on wednesday .
on this front , the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important , above all , because in a number of cases , the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions , further increasing the importance of effective and  |||  adequate  |||  support for less developed regions in europe , combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus .
as mr van orden said , at least the african union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him , and that gives us here in the european union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure , firstly , that mr mugabe stops the arrests and the executions , and secondly , that the constitution is  |||  accepted  |||  for the freedom of the zimbabwean people , which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in zimbabwe .
it is puzzling why the commission and council are promoting a new agreement on access to swift financial data on eu citizens when the mutual legal assistance  |||  agreement  |||  allows for specific requests .
|||  advertising  |||  should respect the values dear to us , but it must be able to exist and to play its role in a market economy without being accused of all evils , which is the tenor of this report .
|||  according  |||  to what emerged from the debate held on the date it was set up , this fund aims to be an institutional reform for solidarity regarding the unforeseen and negative consequences of the globalisation process .
it undermined the critical process that is at the heart of an open society by treating any criticism of the  |||  administration  |||  's policies as unpatriotic , thereby allowing bush to order the invasion of iraq .
i think it is necessary , instead , to initiate genuine , proper relations with belarus in order to integrate this country into europe ,  |||  above  |||  all , in an era in which we find ourselves needing to open relations with russia .
we  |||  adopted  |||  the euro after only five years of membership in the eu and as prime minister fico said on new year 's day , we could see the euro as a lucky talisman bringing us stability and the potential for slovakia to develop even more vigorously in this time of economic crisis .
i voted in favour of the report on ' better schools : an  |||  agenda  |||  for european cooperation ' .
