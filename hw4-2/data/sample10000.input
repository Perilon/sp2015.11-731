therefore , i call on the commission to transpose what is agreed in nagoya into proposals that can be measured and monitored and to develop a long - term vision , so that , in 2011 , we do not need to say once  |||  again  |||  that we have been unable to halt biodiversity loss .

american views of the muslim world are so colored by the conflict in the middle east and the wars in iraq and  |||  afghanistan  |||  that us citizens have no collective appreciation of the fact that most muslims live in asia . or that the four countries with the largest muslim populations -- indonesia , pakistan , india , and bangladesh -- are all cultures with millennia - old histories of coexisting with other religions and cultures .
much of this progress was  |||  achieved  |||  during the cold war , proving that it is possible to create global legal norms even in times of deep political division .
this is not the time for restricting  |||  actions  |||  to the national level .
in fact , the increase in obesity  |||  among  |||  children is quite alarming in europe .

i voted in favour of this document , which states that the agreement of 26 october 2004 concluded with the swiss confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a member state or in switzerland ( the ' dublin  |||  agreement  |||  with switzerland ' ) provides for the possible association of liechtenstein with the dublin acquis by means of a protocol .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to congratulate the committee chair , brian simpson , for leading the work of the committee and work on the file , and , above all , for having  |||  allowed  |||  its conclusion - at least i hope so because the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) will be voting for this - and approval on first reading , and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation .
the fund establishes the possibility of granting aid to those  |||  affected  |||  by natural disasters that cause considerable damage .
monitoring of the use of external experts by the  |||  agencies  |||  must be enabled .
they , too , had a good deal of positive input to offer and we were only a couple of small unresolved issues away from reaching an  |||  agreement  |||  at first reading , although it is , in any case , that bit more democratic to have a vote in the house first .
the fact that it has been  |||  adopted  |||  by a large majority confirms the importance given to improving the use of european funds .
on that point , i  |||  agree  |||  with the previous speaker .
in writing . - ( pt ) this proposal should be in line with the reasons behind the 6th environment  |||  action  |||  programme with the aim of applying current knowledge of prospective and retrospective strategies for assessing the risks and dangers to humans and the environment and to create coherency with other policies .

in particular , the need for better coordination between the different member states , the necessary improvement of the quality of the information that is exchanged , the need to allow other member states automated  |||  access  |||  to certain data contained in member states ' databases and the requirement to harmonise registration and deregistration procedures are ideas that are strongly supported by the commission .
i voted for this resolution on the european union 's strategy for the copenhagen summit on climate change as i am convinced that a comprehensive international  |||  agreement  |||  can actually alter the trend of uncontrolled growth in greenhouse gas emissions .
this is currently a subject of disagreement , and we would insist most emphatically that half - measures and relaxed criteria should not be  |||  agreed  |||  to , in view of either crises or normal human error .
therefore , i think it is absolutely vital that all members of this parliament urge the commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that i mean proposals which would  |||  allow  |||  every region across europe that qualifies , to access structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future .

disparities in health between countries , between regions , between rich and poor , between different ethnic minorities ,  |||  affect  |||  each and every eu member state and , in many places , they are getting wider .

it is important to me that these cultural driving forces have optimum  |||  access  |||  to the new digital and audiovisual formats .

today , the european parliament  |||  adopted  |||  an historic and particularly important directive strengthening the fight against trafficking in human beings .
the latter is fully taken into account in our common efforts to design an improved ets , and the position of those industries will certainly be considered in the context of any international  |||  agreement  |||  that is negotiated and the implications for european industries , particularly energy - intensive ones , if we do not create the level playing field that we are seeking through negotiation .
it means that next year , if the growth figures collapse again , we will stand up in front of everyone and have no  |||  answer  |||  to the economic situation .

economic reforms have progressed ,  |||  allowing  |||  for a steady growth of the tunisian economy as well as of trade volume with the eu .

without calling into question the importance of the work done by the acp - eu joint parliamentary assembly ( jpa ) in 2009 or its undeniable contribution to development cooperation , i cannot fail to express my concern about the content of point 6 of the joly report : ' encourages the jpa to continue to work on this area and to explore  |||  additional  |||  and innovative sources of financing for development , such as an international financial transaction tax ' .
many warlords are indeed carrying on their struggle , often with foreign ( and even  |||  american  |||  ) backing .

in view of recent developments in the situation and by  |||  agreement  |||  with the political groups , i would like to propose the following changes to the order of business on wednesday .
on this front , the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important , above all , because in a number of cases , the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions , further increasing the importance of effective and  |||  adequate  |||  support for less developed regions in europe , combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus .
as mr van orden said , at least the african union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him , and that gives us here in the european union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure , firstly , that mr mugabe stops the arrests and the executions , and secondly , that the constitution is  |||  accepted  |||  for the freedom of the zimbabwean people , which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in zimbabwe .

we  |||  adopted  |||  the euro after only five years of membership in the eu and as prime minister fico said on new year 's day , we could see the euro as a lucky talisman bringing us stability and the potential for slovakia to develop even more vigorously in this time of economic crisis .

that being the case , if we cannot reach an agreement with korea , would the commission accept that dg trade might as well pack up and go home as regards free trade agreements , because if we cannot  |||  agree  |||  with korea we are not going to agree with india , asean or on any other such agreements we are negotiating ?
i am  |||  actually  |||  very hopeful that trade will begin to play a larger role in this parliament .
the presidency of a state that has emerged from a communist dictatorship - and this should not be belittled - with a prime minister who was himself a victim of this dictatorship , is in fact a presidency that not only deserves the full support of all democrats , but also has a great opportunity to recapture the hearts of the people  |||  again  |||  because it gives us here in parliament as well as in europe the opportunity once again to show that change is possible and in the long run freedom always prevails and democracy will always triumph !

when it comes to emissions trading , the  |||  agreement  |||  reached on solidarity with the new member states from central and eastern europe and on taking into account their efforts during the period after 1990 is evidence of the viability of the european values which made europe attractive to a large number of peoples .

madam president , allow me to say that we demand that regulations which apply to goods produced in the european union also be  |||  adopted  |||  by countries which export to the european union .
thus in view of such occurrences , i am very reluctant to  |||  accept  |||  the transfer of personal data from one country to another .

the pentagon reports that  |||  american  |||  army drillmasters do " less shouting at everyone , " because today 's generation responds better to instructors who play " a more counseling - type role . "

the european initiative to create the galileo and european geostationary navigation overlay service ( egnos ) programmes will not only enable europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs , but ,  |||  above  |||  all , will also bring improvements to the daily lives of europeans , and will generate direct and indirect benefits for the european economy .

modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which ,  |||  above  |||  all in the last few decades , new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations .

mr president , lest we forget that there are people  |||  affected  |||  by these problems , i met a young irishman on the flight to frankfurt today , on his way to australia with a one - way ticket , and he is just one of thousands who are doing this because of our economic and banking problems .
for all these reasons we must raise our voices and call firstly on the political parties to condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by their followers , and secondly on the government itself to reopen spaces for democratic participation , to respect freedom of expression , to stop banning marches , and to  |||  allow  |||  all ngos to receive international cooperation aid and not only aid from venezuela for pro - government associations .

( mt ) please  |||  allow  |||  me to start by congratulating the council for the courageous conclusions it reached last week .
financial corrections to agricultural payments , such as those deriving from the commission 's  |||  annual  |||  clearance decisions in the framework of the balancing procedure , relate to large sums , which the member states have to repay to the community budget as corrections or financial penalties because of their failure to establish adequate control systems .
in poland , the two are combined in a denunciation of the " original sin " of the 1989 compromise between moderate dissident elites and moderate communist elites , which enabled a non - violent exit from communism , but  |||  allegedly  |||  allowed the ex - communists to convert their political power into economic power .

( sl ) i am pleased that the first meeting of the council to be held  |||  according  |||  to the rules of the treaty of lisbon is upon us .
in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i express my full support for the decision to at least leave the agriculture budget unchanged and i - like many of my colleagues in the agri committee - am strongly opposed to the  |||  amendment  |||  tabled by the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) which would accept possible future cuts in agriculture resources in order to fund other activities .
the position  |||  achieved  |||  by the euro in the international markets brings undoubted benefits , such as better protection from external shocks .
( pl ) madam president , thank you for this report and for the negotiations that have been undertaken ,  |||  although  |||  i must say i feel somewhat dissatisfied .
rapporteur . - ( fi ) mr president , the voting list also has  |||  amendment  |||  8 replaced with amendment 14 .
we also , however , need the cooperation of the  |||  african  |||  union and the arab league , which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof .
every orthodox economist would suggest that what we need to do at a time like this is to  |||  allow  |||  some of the eurozone economies to print their own currencies again , to devalue , to buy themselves time to price themselves back into the market .
lastly , i fully  |||  agree  |||  with mrs berès 's call for quality jobs .
currency union cannot be separated - even  |||  according  |||  to the science of economics - from fiscal union , and the latter cannot exist without political union .
the march organisers were also detained and interrogated  |||  along  |||  with mr milinkiewicz and mrs kazulin , who had not participated in the march .
we need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms , create a euro -  |||  american  |||  assembly and , most importantly , create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world - the middle east , iran , afghanistan - and relations with the emerging powers .
we have come out emphatically in favour of an integrated strategy that takes  |||  account  |||  of all possible means of reducing co2 emissions .
this means ,  |||  above  |||  all , that the much - vaunted middle classes are being asked -- or soon will be asked -- to contribute more toward the costs of these services , either by higher taxes or through privatisation of the financial burdens .
these include : amendment 11 on demographic trends ,  |||  amendment  |||  25 stressing the need for better harmonisation between working and family life , amendment 50 on support for member states in promoting part - time work , amendment 35 on optional maternity leave before birth , amendment 53 clarifying that women on maternity leave may have their salaries raised , and amendment 56 on workers ' retirement rights .
i am sorry but i cannot reopen the debate on a comparative  |||  analysis  |||  of two resolutions .
right at the start of this crisis , we in the european parliament were  |||  among  |||  the first to sound the alarm of the damaging consequences that the crisis might have on women unless adequate measures were taken .
the ecb continues to be exclusively preoccupied by inflation and budgets -- problems which the united states solved  |||  almost  |||  ten years ago during the bush administration and which also in europe continue to obsess us only by reason of limited intellectual agility .
if we cannot  |||  answer  |||  this question , google , i am afraid , will be the only player able to meet the needs of the libraries themselves .
|||  although  |||  it has not been part of the debate , i would also like to put on record my personal support for an opt - out rather than an opt - in system for organ donation .
three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with  |||  america  |||  , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and unethical , if not destabilizing , force in the world .
i also  |||  agree  |||  with the need to prolong workers ' careers through a modern employment policy and improvement of working conditions , and i agree with the need to make pension systems and the information provided to citizens more transparent .
through this report , the european parliament explicitly asks the council and the european commission to take better account of agricultural interests in international trade negotiations , particularly in discussions with south america , a large livestock farming and grain production region which does not  |||  always  |||  meet european quality standards .
the tragedy is that the  |||  african  |||  national congress , south africa 's dominant political party , was so much in thrall to mbeki that he was not deposed many years ago .
we were  |||  always  |||  of one mind in setting objectives for the european institute of technology : we want to strengthen europe 's capacity for innovation .
at first , us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld declared this international  |||  agreement  |||  inapplicable .
ladies and gentlemen , allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to mrs lynne , whose report , which is currently being discussed here , is without doubt an important element of the global effort to ensure progress  |||  across  |||  the european union .
as the rapporteur bairbre de brún stated , that support was worth eur 1.65 billion and there is still  |||  another  |||  eur 333 million to come .
on the positive side , a tragic legacy of  |||  american  |||  history has been transcended .
if we have  |||  another  |||  csdp mission and another round of stability instrument training without a political process leading somewhere , i do not think it will help us .
( ro ) madam president , the eu 's industrial policy must create an  |||  adequate  |||  framework for boosting the industrial sector 's contribution to eu gdp .
to tackle these problems , we came up with an " open data / information liquidity " project , which will advocate and organize the publication , exchange , aggregation , and  |||  analysis  |||  of health data -- not just general statistics , but specific data about health outcomes in terms of drugs and treatments , hospital performance , and the like .
it is no  |||  accident  |||  that the main cradle of this strategy is the body : foucault says that through the political technology of the body we can read the shared history of power relations .
this report presents the basic obstacles to the correct use of the structural funds and how they can be overcome , using a series of criteria to classify certain projects and  |||  actions  |||  as best practice and referring to the lack of a commonly acceptable definition of best practice .
we have managed to finish the debate on time and ,  |||  above  |||  all , in the calm atmosphere required so that we can all listen to each other .
mr president , once  |||  again  |||  , i would like to express my very sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs , especially those present - mrs ulrike rodust , mr kuhn and mr ferreira , and also to mr kuhn and mr alain cadec , for their warm and kind words on the subject of my report .
thus , we have  |||  adopted  |||  some conclusions that advance the goals and instruments of the commission and the member states in eradicating violence against women .
recently mr lukashenko expressed the desire to stand  |||  again  |||  for the presidency .
the general context is that the circumstances under which the budget for 2011 will be  |||  adopted  |||  are very challenging because the margin under heading 5 is very limited and because the successful implementation of the treaty of lisbon is the priority for all the european institutions .
the most important thing is to strive for this three - way alliance , which is necessary in order to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  , and to propose , from the outset , a 30 % reduction in emissions .
normally one does not allow a single member or two members to create a political group ; it is necessary  |||  always  |||  to define what that threshold should be .
of course , i cannot but  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur mr trakatellis 's assertion that the draft applies to diseases which may be rare but which afflict thousands of people .
it was also  |||  agreed  |||  that all national protective measures would have to be fully in compliance with the provisions of the ec treaty on state aid and the internal market .
i therefore wish to draw the attention of those fellow members who object to the principle of preferential treatment and who propose  |||  amendments  |||  seeking to remove the establishment of this principle from the report to the fact that , as a hungarian citizen and in the name of the citizens of all the new member states , i consider it unacceptable not to establish firmly the principle that workers from member states are given preference over workers from third countries .
consequently , i would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are  |||  adequate  |||  resources of the relevant kind in place , so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them , because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business .
in addition , the fact that the wet grip values for tyres will , in future , be improved again is something that is to be viewed as a positive development , as is the fact that tyre pressure monitoring systems , lane departure warning systems and  |||  advanced  |||  emergency braking systems are to be considered for other categories of vehicle .
a radioactive leak , the rupture of an undersea oil well and ,  |||  above  |||  all , co2 emissions do not threaten just one country .
the proposal for a directive on which the european parliament was consulted is  |||  another  |||  example of how europe is able to act in a practical manner to protect european citizens .
we have to  |||  actually  |||  have some mechanism for settling disputes .
in particular , moreover , we in parliament are  |||  agreed  |||  that neither the commission 's preliminary draft budget nor the council 's draft - which , as we know , has pruned back the appropriations for both commitments and payments contained in the commission 's estimates , is particularly inspiring .
the prospect of joining the eu has  |||  always  |||  been of great importance for the whole country , that is , for its ethnic groups as well , whether large or small .
there is not yet an agreement that extends to direct investments in energy - related activities carried out on the investor 's own  |||  account  |||  in the secondary sector , such as mining , refining , energy generation and energy distribution .
if populations are compared between 1970 and 2010 , which is when there is monitoring data , the population of bluefin tuna is  |||  above  |||  15 % .
in writing . - i enthusiastically supported the  |||  amendment  |||  proposing to reduce the two september part - sessions to one .
under the prüm council decision , member states grant each other limited  |||  access  |||  to their dna and fingerprint databases in order to check for matches .
mr president of the council , i  |||  agree  |||  with you , of course , that there is a moral crisis , of that there can be no doubt .
however ,  |||  above  |||  all , we need to attract women to the rural world and prevent the exodus that is occurring increasingly , because the position of women in our society progresses slowly , but at least it is progressing in the urban world .
is extending working time and raising the retirement age , i wonder , the right response to increased competitiveness , rather than what we believe : a better salary and secure working conditions that will contribute to productivity , and will ,  |||  above  |||  all , improve living standards ?
i wholeheartedly  |||  agree  |||  with her arguments , and i also hope that they will influence her group tomorrow when it votes on our amendments to this report .
nonetheless , i did not vote in favour because , like other free trade agreements concluded by the eu , it does not take into  |||  account  |||  the precarious situation of the agricultural labourers in developing countries , or the negative impact on the population .
it is a solid report that will reflect realities even better if  |||  amendments  |||  15 and 16 by the rapporteur are adopted , for instance concerning the timetable of the process .
by the way ,  |||  according  |||  to the treaty , it is the council which authorises the signature of the agreements , but parliament always has the last word .
foreign governments began to change these polities after  |||  al-qaeda  |||  in iraq bombed three hotels in amman , jordan , in november 2005 , killing 60 people .
i myself have come because you are the democratic voice of the european people , that is ,  |||  almost  |||  500 million people .
i did not shake hands ,  |||  although  |||  both karadzic and mladic tried to .
corrigendum to a text  |||  adopted  |||  : see minutes
the european commission has confirmed on several occasions that some neighbouring countries - ukraine , russia , sweden and turkey - are ready to join the european stress test programme , but it is still unclear what specific  |||  action  |||  the commission intends to take to bring about cooperation , and how the situation will pan out with regard to belarus .
mobilisation of globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund : application egf / 2010/027 nl / north brabant division 18 / netherlands (
commissioner , we have just received mrs fischer boel 's proposal in relation to the cap health check , and neither health nor animal welfare are recipients of the funds to be  |||  allocated  |||  to rural development to deal with the new challenges , contrary to what the services were apparently expecting , or so i was told .
the assent was positive : it  |||  agreed  |||  to israel 's participation in the community programme , given that it was already participating in the seventh framework programme for research , that its application related solely to the ' innovation and technology ' programme , that all member countries of the neighbourhood policy are entitled to apply to participate , and thus that it constituted neither a special favour to israel nor a reassessment of its political status .
the background to the events of the last few days have been the aggressive  |||  actions  |||  of the kremlin , which aims to extend its domination in the region of south - eastern europe .
mr president , latin  |||  america  |||  has a population of 600 million , it accounts for 10 % of the world 's gdp , it is home to 40 % of the planet 's vegetable species and has a wealth of exceptional human resources .

we need long - term stability for the difficult , labour - intensive and costly  |||  activity  |||  of milk production .
mr president , commissioner , i have been searching in vain for an  |||  answer  |||  to the question of why we are debating a resolution on the summit with russia on the eve of the summit itself and voting on it on the day the summit takes place in nizhny novgorod .
when the british historian timothy garton ash , writing in thenew york review of books , distinguished the us and europe by paraphrasing the title of a bestselling book , saying that "  |||  americans  |||  are from mars , europeans are from venus , " some american readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate europe and a macho america .
two gue  |||  amendments  |||  were adopted ( equal access to healthcare / treatment and colombia ) .
tajikistan , however , is on something of a better path , and this agreement will  |||  allow  |||  the european union to have some influence on the situation there .
i am therefore certain that we will reach an  |||  agreement  |||  on the reserve .
since the  |||  agreement  |||  in lisbon there have been grounds for a certain optimism about the future of the european union , firstly with regard to the member states ' ability to agree ; secondly , there is a cautious attitude towards assessing the agreement achieved , since it will not be possible to evaluate the real effect of the treaty in that area until it has been in force for several years ; the third is a negative assessment of the fact that , following the outcome of the referendums in the netherlands and france , the constitutional treaty became a treaty partly by avoiding listening to public opinion .
will the commission now take  |||  action  |||  to make use of the results from the publicly - funded research and ensure that these chemicals with a high risk to human health can be dealt with as a priority under reach ?
although in november i asked the european commission a question regarding this issue and the  |||  answer  |||  was that new proposals intending roma integration would be launched , i hereby ask the commission to come up with clarifications on these intentions .
if we take the florenz report and say , ' this is the state of play in the climate policy debate in the european parliament ' , we might conclude that there is a wonderful ' climate '  |||  among  |||  members here in the european parliament , were it not for the fact that - like the beagle boys in the famous cartoons , whom we call the ' tank - busters ' in german - a very different agenda is being pursued in the same place at the same time !
at least 30 % of the heroin produced in  |||  afghanistan  |||  comes to europe and russia through tajikistan .
in summary , it is of vital importance that we concern ourselves with cultural and creative industries , which is why we must create as soon as possible - for artists and creative minds alike -  |||  adequate  |||  conditions that take into consideration unique characteristics , in the areas of mobility , intellectual property rights and social protection .
enhanced cooperation would facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market and would eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods , which would increase the number of inventors and would provide  |||  access  |||  to unitary patent protection throughout the eu .
besides , widespread revulsion against syria for its alleged role in the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , particularly  |||  among  |||  lebanon 's maronites , sunnis , and druze , means that lebanon is unlikely to ever become totally subservient again -- that is , unless hezbollah gets to call the shots .
finally , let me say something about the topic which also features at the top of the swedish presidency 's  |||  agenda  |||  , namely climate change , because we only have a few weeks to go to the copenhagen conference .
if the economic  |||  activities  |||  intensify over the coming years , then it will be important that we ensure a proper balance between the environment and economics and , in doing so , that we involve the local population .
the amount of the ecb 's " replacement lending " is shown by the so - called target2  |||  account  |||  , which measures the deficit or surplus of a country 's financial transactions with other countries .
since parliament and the council make decisions together with regard to objectives and content , and taking into account the fact that the council adopted its position on 10 december 2010 without , however , having taken into consideration parliament 's amendments relating to the procedures applicable to the adoption of programming documents and those relating to functioning , i  |||  agree  |||  that the position adopted by parliament at first reading should be restored in order to make sure that parliament is treated on an equal footing with the council / member states and that the programming structure of the industrialised countries instrument recognises the changes introduced by the treaty of lisbon .
but that would miss the most important point about  |||  america  |||  's role in the world : the same idealism that made kennedy so popular is also driving the decline in america 's international prestige .
the  |||  amendment  |||  tabled by mr fox attempted to combine the august and the september plenary sessions in one week .
this will  |||  allow  |||  croatia , if it is treated fairly , to complete the negotiations this year .
it has been the most successful development partner at fulfilling its commitments , notably in terms of market  |||  access  |||  , rules of origin and debt alleviation .

it is an undeniable fact that , until now , even with the stability and growth pact , even with a european central bank , the external representation of the eu in international financial bodies has fallen far short of the  |||  actual  |||  importance of economic and monetary union and what the european union project represents .
i am therefore pleased with the adoption of the 2010-2013 strategic  |||  action  |||  plan and with the partnerships established .
he made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is  |||  actually  |||  not the lack of legislation , but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market .

the rise of islamists throughout the region as the sole power capable of exploiting the opportunities of free elections -- hamas ' victory in palestine and the muslim brotherhood 's spectacular gains in the 2005 egyptian elections are but the most noteworthy -- the ascendancy to regional hegemony of shiite iran , and the sense among arab rulers that the embattled bush  |||  administration  |||  is running out of steam have all combined to stall the promising drive to political reform in the region .
( sk ) mr president , it is necessary to take  |||  account  |||  of many aspects when evaluating the report on the progress of iceland .

for example , one of my constituents , jeff stockdale from hull , a former fishermen , has invented a revolutionary pot trap that would encourage fish to enter it in order to escape from the tidal flow , but it would  |||  allow  |||  small fish to escape and larger ones to be released before being brought to the surface , if that should be necessary to avoid exceeding one 's quota .

one important weakness in the first energy efficiency national action plans , over and above the huge delay in submitting them on the part of certain member states , including greece , is the fact that the ambitious plans are not accompanied by clearly defined practical proposals with added value , despite the fact that , according to recent figures released by the european commission , if the target of achieving energy savings of 20 % were  |||  achieved  |||  , the eu would use approximately 400 mtoe less primary energy and co2 emissions would fall by 860 mt.

to my mind , the question is this : why do we find it so easy to  |||  agree  |||  on instruments for adaptation and yet so difficult to agree on ways of actually combating global warming ?
one final reservation i should like to mention is the failure to take  |||  account  |||  of the special circumstances of forest protection .

based on my notes on what has been said by representatives of individual parliamentary groups , it is not at all my view that our agenda is too liberal or too conservative ; our agenda arises from the long - term aims and long - term  |||  agenda  |||  of the european union , and the czech contribution to it , the czech imprint , showed itself in the very first days of the new year as being well - conceived , because our emphasis on energy security may lead us , unexpectedly and none too soon , into some very thorough , in - depth discussion on how to ensure the independence and freedom of the european union , which presupposes independence or less dependence on energy imports and sources outside the european union .

tomorrow , in my opinion , the european council must take a clear decision on a new strategy - the heads of state and government can do so - a new strategy whereby those wishing to remain on board may remain on board , but europe has to move  |||  ahead  |||  in the general interest .
ending the  |||  american  |||  occupation in iraq and imposing an arab - israeli peace would help , but they are no panacea .
this may seem like a large  |||  amount  |||  of funding , but in fact , it is very little .
but the biggest difficulty in using big data to build a better society is being able to develop a human - scale , intuitive understanding of social physics .  |||  although  |||  dense , continuous data and modern computation allow us to map many details about society , and to explain how communities might work , such raw mathematical models contain too many variables and complex relationships for most people to understand .
this development , which has serious consequences , represents a two - pronged challenge , namely , managing more than 1 200 bilateral investment treaties ( bits ) and defining a european policy for future investment that meets the expectations of investors and beneficiary states , while also respecting the eu 's external  |||  action  |||  objectives .
why it is necessary for the council to constantly make those cuts is a mystery to me , as we have been holding discussions based on that commission letter of  |||  amendment  |||  since as far back as the treaty of amsterdam , as it provides us with the most recent figures available .
in conclusion , i am happy to support this framework  |||  agreement  |||  because i know that in the sixth framework programme , developments in science and research were already being integrated very actively and with genuinely good results .
in writing . - ( it ) the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 1334/2000 setting up a community regime for the control mechanism of exports of dual - use items and technology , as tabled on 7 february 2011 ,  |||  aims  |||  to supply the union with an efficient regime of preventive measures designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons , including weapons of mass destruction .
the resolution  |||  adopted  |||  by the committee on regional development proposes the creation , as from the forthcoming post - 2013 programming period , of a single strategic framework to ensure a common approach and to capitalise on synergies between all actions which serve to further cohesion policy objectives as defined by the treaties and funded by the erdf , the cohesion fund , the european social fund ( esf ) , the european agricultural fund for rural development ( eafrd ) and the european fisheries fund ( eff ) .
in those six months , we were also able to obtain agreements on the management of speculative funds and other  |||  alternative  |||  investment funds as well as on the rating agencies .
by adopting the joint eu - armenia enp  |||  action  |||  plan in 2006 , we acquired a policy tool for promoting the observance of principles based on our shared values .
this will  |||  allow  |||  a future mediterranean economic area with the new democracies in the south , and i hope that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have marked the work on this subject will lead to the permanent involvement of parliament in planning and evaluating this policy .
the zaleski report has its basis in a commission proposal whose aim is only to renew some of the cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  with ukraine following the country 's accession to the wto .
this intergovernmental approach lay behind the lisbon  |||  agenda  |||  's failure to deliver the results needed to make europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010 , and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor , the new " europe 2020 " strategy .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin first by thanking parliament for  |||  allowing  |||  me at this key moment to address this sitting with a matter as unquestionably sensitive as the economic partnership agreements .
i have been in rome and i must say that apart from the final declaration which is , i must  |||  agree  |||  , a little bit disappointing , there have been very good discussions and also a very good presence , and something can come out of it .
|||  another  |||  issue voiced by the citizens that merits our attention concerns the deadline for calls for submissions of projects for financing under the european social fund .
european  |||  action  |||  has been joint action .
ever since george w. bush took office , america 's  |||  annual  |||  real gdp growth has averaged 2.3 % -- a pace that would have been acclaimed as normal and satisfactory when george w. bush 's father or ronald reagan was president , but that after the clinton boom now seems tawdry and sluggish .
madam president , i consider that an anti - drug plan in  |||  afghanistan  |||  , consisting in the control of opium quantities by using them to obtain analgesics and other derivatives , might represent one and not the only alternative economic solution and a means of reducing poppy cultivation .
we have a broad  |||  agenda  |||  that will feature progress in many areas .
i would like to highlight the main directions in the fight against poverty  |||  among  |||  women : combating poverty among women by means of employment policy and social protection ; the importance of social dialogue and civil society in combating poverty among women ; the importance of financial aid in combating poverty .
these two traits ,  |||  although  |||  they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of american and british conservatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that germany now requires .
so there is no clarity on this issue but , once  |||  again  |||  , the problem for the european parliament , for the eu in general , is that there is no consistency across member states , and yet our citizens are accessing services outside their own country , and they want to do that .
when  |||  adopted  |||  , the programme will enable them to accomplish their mission in a more independent and more efficient manner .
obama has called for  |||  additional  |||  united states and nato troops to stabilize the situation , but too many foreign troops will only increase afghan nationalist reactions .
here in the us , it might seem like an image of our future , as public debt comes perilously close to 100 % of  |||  annual  |||  gdp and continues to rise .
attention should also be drawn to the fact that this new agreement has opened the way to opportunities in terms of  |||  additional  |||  investment and market access as well as strengthening cooperation in regulatory areas such as safety , security and the environment , where both sides agreed a dedicated joint statement on the environment .
i should like to thank mr moraes for his excellent work and i share with him the idea of adopting a constructive approach that includes most of the amendments proposed by the commission , as well as numerous technical amendments  |||  agreed  |||  in the council during negotiations on this instrument .
on the other hand , i think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international  |||  agenda  |||  and that , whenever world leaders meet , for example , latterly in pittsburgh for the g20 , there is talk of development cooperation and development policy .
in  |||  addition  |||  to the identically tailored imf - eu programmes that they want to implement in ireland and now portugal , they are preparing to reinforce the attack on greece , squeezing its people even further .
during those two decades , your  |||  annual  |||  average return would have been more than 16 % .
the voting list also has  |||  amendment  |||  8 replaced with amendment 14 .
on the subject of sovereign debt , i advocated that the rating agencies should avoid pro - cyclicality in their work and take into  |||  account  |||  the forecasts of the main international financial institutions .
i can assure you that it is the commission 's utmost  |||  ambition  |||  to deliver on this very important strategy .
we would remind the house that the chadian authorities must approve the minurcat operating procedures as soon as possible because any additional delays could obviously  |||  affect  |||  the deployment schedule for the chad humanitarian protection police force , more than half of the budget for which is financed by the commission .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur that the two are closely linked .
moreover , the problems relating to the eu - mercosur association  |||  agreement  |||  are not adequately resolved in the report .
given this clearly unacceptable situation , particularly in comparison with other types of bus , what steps is the commission taking to ensure that there are  |||  adequate  |||  safety measures for the operation of ' bendy buses ' and that drivers receive the necessary level of training ?
i believe you will  |||  agree  |||  that that is perversion .
because of lousy salaries in the state  |||  administration  |||  , many young and gifted people avoid government service , preferring to look for better - paid jobs in the private sector , or to emigrate .
with this in mind we agree with the idea that union vessels that operate in deep - sea areas that are not subject to any regional fisheries organisation or  |||  agreement  |||  should be subject to community regulations governing the conditions that they must fulfil in order to obtain the relevant special permits at these depths , and specifying the subsequent conduct that they must observe , the information they must provide , etc.
let us not forget that , in certain member states , there is no single centre for forensic study but rather several , taking into  |||  account  |||  the distribution of territories and existing police and legal systems .
the commission could partially  |||  accept  |||  the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling .
|||  although  |||  , undoubtedly , the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems , it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries , from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness , and from the absence of coordination in european economic policy .
but i abstained on the final vote on the instrument ( dci ) itself as , directly or indirectly , the  |||  african  |||  peace facility was funded through this instrument , and this funding was used inter alia for police and army training missions .
i hope that after the compromise  |||  among  |||  the political parties represented in this chamber , we will have a good first reading agreement from the council and within a few years , perhaps , i will be able to quote here in this chamber the useful data from the latest european pesticides statistics .
small purchases at current panic prices , vulture - fund style , are  |||  always  |||  possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief .
we want a global  |||  agreement  |||  , but that naturally requires the involvement of all the major players : china , india and above all the us .
i agree with you that the priority is safety , and that the crisis that has  |||  affected  |||  us is a complicated one , but we took too long to communicate , because we did so five days after the first attempt .
it is worth remembering that the uprising in tunisia which set off the domino effect  |||  across  |||  the entire middle east began with the self - immolation of a poor street food trader .
i therefore ask you to support mr mulder 's amendment 31 proposing a threshold of eur 100 , a compromise i feel could be  |||  acceptable  |||  to all .
the recent humanitarian disasters in haiti and pakistan demonstrated once  |||  again  |||  that the eu 's disaster - response capability needs to be greatly enhanced .
all older children or  |||  adults  |||  are charged myr 69.00 per night and person for extra beds .
here the major challenge will be for the ccp to  |||  accept  |||  that wto membership presumes that disputes will be resolved by an independent , rules - based , supra - national body rather than by party - fiat or through the mediation of local political connections .
it is time for tangible  |||  action  |||  .
i have  |||  always  |||  asked why those studies disappeared , but the truth is that it was worrying , so they have told us time and time again .
i hope that we can definitely achieve the goals you mentioned in your question with this  |||  amount  |||  of money .
unfortunately , this coexistence has not  |||  always  |||  been peaceful .
however , i believe that we should adopt more general systems of social security , which would apply both to open - ended contracts and to part - time employment : in short , the intention is that these forms of employment should also be provided with  |||  adequate  |||  social security cover , not that open - ended contracts should be weakened .
we are hoping that the new  |||  action  |||  plan just announced by the commissioner will be implemented as soon as possible in order to improve existing mechanisms by extending technical and human support , guaranteeing financial support and increasing planned budgetary resources .
while the major problems caused by a bankrupt economic system can be resolved through  |||  adequate  |||  measures , human beings need time to forget , forgive and adapt to a new way of life , even if it is incomparably better .
we have made a preliminary  |||  analysis  |||  of energy efficiency action plans , which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts .
to function and remain socially  |||  acceptable  |||  , however , capitalism must be as clean as possible .
but doubling us foreign aid involves a modest  |||  amount  |||  of money , compared to what will be saved by pulling out of iraq .
i also strongly support the appeal made by guido sacconi , the committee 's chairman , that the post - election parliament should  |||  address  |||  this issue and ensure that there is the most robust approach here to issues concerning climate change .
to conclude , the aim of the reforms requested by the european union is not only to enable this country to form closer links with the european union but ,  |||  above  |||  all , to ensure that its entire population benefits from the progress that we are trying to encourage .
what about the unlawful  |||  actions  |||  against romanians in rome ?
·sri mulyani indrawati is  |||  another  |||  highly qualified candidate from southeast asia .
mr president , one parliamentary priority is also to  |||  address  |||  an alarming situation where the human rights council 's activities have resulted in extreme politicisation .
obviously if the implementing agreements later bring to light things that are not  |||  acceptable  |||  from the point of view of community law , we shall see what needs to be done , but we shall do something .
i believe that it is the european union 's duty to promote good quality products , along with taking  |||  action  |||  to protect them globally .
the report also  |||  adds  |||  value to the current debate concerning the possible ways forward in this regard .
but even if the fed does not admit it in its forecasts , the price of this " insurance policy " will  |||  almost  |||  certainly be higher inflation down the road , and perhaps for several years .
debate over iraq dominated international diplomacy , and took up  |||  almost  |||  the entire un agenda .
the  |||  answer  |||  is making your own depend ( ) function in /etc/conf.d/net.
on behalf of the efd group . - mr president , following the report by the honourable member , mrs guy - quint , dated april 2008 , the new legal framework  |||  affecting  |||  budgetary matters should now be ready for adoption .
fifteen years ago in my book the end of history and the last man i argued that , if a society wanted to be modern , there was no  |||  alternative  |||  to a market economy and a democratic political system .
rapidshare free premium  |||  account  |||  from rvsdi.com is one form of thanks to loyal visitors and visitors who stray from the search engine - with the keyword " rapidshare premium account " - which has opened a blog rvsdi.com .
at the same time , women from disadvantaged backgrounds must be guaranteed equal  |||  access  |||  to public health systems , as well as gynaecological and obstetric care , and to decent housing , justice , sports and culture .
the current protocol to the fisheries partnership  |||  agreement  |||  ( fpa ) with the islamic republic of mauritania expires on 31 july 2012 , and the commission intends to launch negotiations regarding its renewal , for which it has received a prescriptive mandate from the council .
this subject comes under its competence and , sadly , i cannot give a meaningful  |||  answer  |||  .
the few  |||  african  |||  countries that already have such institutions in place -- among them south africa , kenya , nigeria , ghana , zambia , and senegal -- are clearly moving in the right direction .
madam president , please  |||  allow  |||  me to begin by recounting a story .
in principle , the signature of the horizontal  |||  agreement  |||  at the summit should be accompanied by the signature of the financing agreement on a new civil aviation cooperation programme covering eur 12.5 million .
it will also be vital to conduct an information campaign  |||  aimed  |||  at making citizens aware of the possibility of issuing a european protection order .
had  |||  american  |||  forces not expelled the british from us territory in the first , and had abraham lincoln and the union not prevailed in the second , the country would have been balkanized and unable to become the dominant power of the twentieth century .
the first reforms to  |||  afghanistan  |||  's army will only make these divisions worse .
the fact that the organisers of last year 's flotilla are planning to repeat their  |||  action  |||  on the anniversary of the incident and meps from the gue and greens / efa political groups organised a hearing at the ep on 10 may put the issue yet again in the spotlight .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  with the target of 147 g of co2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the eu , if it is confirmed that this option is viable .
mr president , we are debating a dossier today which has put on our  |||  agenda  |||  in recent months a number of issues of principle .
high unemployment , particularly  |||  among  |||  young people , locks roma in a vicious cycle of impoverishment and exclusion , further driving down living standards and leaving many in marginalized settlements without access to electricity , clean water , or other basic utilities .
if we find that some of the  |||  alternatives  |||  are no less dangerous , then i am sure the commissioner or his successors will be back to tell us so and to bring forward a proposal - and if they do not i am sure carl schlyter will .
because of the sponsorship  |||  agreement  |||  was finalized just days before the first world cup jumping , remained for the rather expensive airbrush painting , designed by stiegl - house graphic designer hannes eder , implementing only two days .
thus , in order to keep the current -  |||  account  |||  deficit stable , the trade deficit must shrink .
|||  according  |||  to the case law of the court of justice , any restriction on such recognition must not give rise to discrimination , must be reasoned and must be proportionate .
unfortunately , the latest political incident involving the democracy - promoting activities of  |||  american  |||  ngos has cooled bilateral relations and threatens the $ 1.3 billion in military assistance that egypt receives annually from the united states .
the average import price for the us in the period 2005-2007 was eur 12.45 per kilogram ; for the first quarter of 2008 the price  |||  actually  |||  rose slightly to eur 13.6 per kilogram .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur that we should apply the cooperation specific programme which identifies fuel cells and hydrogen as one of the six areas where a jti could have particular relevance .
the substance of the report  |||  actually  |||  takes care of all the criticism that has been presented .
regarding transparency , i expect a balance to be achieved when establishing the european external  |||  action  |||  service .
last month , on 24 june , china also took a positive step by reopening  |||  access  |||  for foreign tourists to tibet .
i voted in favour of the conclusion of the new  |||  agreement  |||  between the european union and the united states of america on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of the terrorist finance tracking program , because i felt that the new proposal tabled by the commission offered eu citizens increased assurances , in particular as regards data protection .
while this process will generate a significant amount of value -- more than $ 5 trillion in 2025 ,  |||  according  |||  to mgi estimates -- it will not be distributed evenly among workers , leaving many to confront the need to retrain for new jobs .
in more immediate terms , i call on the commission to authorise a oneoff increase in cofinancing via the erdf and esf regional funds for projects in the regions  |||  affected  |||  , within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer .
this new strategic approach to culture sets common objectives and  |||  aims  |||  to propel the economic , social and political value of culture by strengthening its transversal role .
similarly , the effect of human  |||  activities  |||  , considered even by this report to be the main cause for climate change , is also questioned by some scientists .
in writing . - ( lt ) we must combat tuberculosis , because this disease kills nearly two million people worldwide each year , and  |||  almost  |||  a third of the world 's population is infected by it .
|||  although  |||  i would prefer not to see casinos going up anywhere in the european union , i still consider this the least bad solution .
we would not want to waste all the work done and the positive things achieved , including , for example , the contribution of our  |||  amendment  |||  on the right of recourse , which is intended to bring about a clear improvement in the activity of small traders without harming consumer rights .
in some states in europe it is still not illegal , and would the commission encourage member states to  |||  adopt  |||  a common position on dealing with this very difficult issue ?
it is also proposed that we should have a common support service to help the small  |||  agencies  |||  with burdensome administrative tasks .
they did not make arrangements for passengers to have  |||  access  |||  to free telephone , fax , e-mail or internet facilities , and did not provide transfer or accommodation , either , even though passengers are entitled to such support under the eu regulations in force .
|||  among  |||  other things , we would like to see a reduction in the proportion of the eu budget allocated to agricultural policy , the retention and development of cross - compliance and the adaptation of the system to the market .
|||  among  |||  other things , it will be vital to refocus the priorities of the framework research programme , so as to enable adequate coverage of this important area of research .
is it not , after all , the case that standardising the time all  |||  across  |||  europe to one time zone would be beneficial just from the transport perspective ?
first , we must complete economic and monetary union by creating a european stability  |||  agency  |||  for common eurobonds and i am glad that president barroso did not rule out the idea of eurobonds today .
as i have mentioned on many previous occasions , i firmly believe that the failure to reach agreement on the  |||  amendment  |||  is a bad message for european workers and enterprises , for european institutions and , by extension , for europe as a whole .
we cannot solve the issues surrounding the  |||  accessibility  |||  of food by violating food safety requirements and putting people 's health at risk .
without knowing all possible  |||  alternatives  |||  , we cannot form a limited , testable set of clear hypotheses .
this plan includes concrete measures for supporting small and medium - sized enterprises , the most important of which are the measures aimed at improving  |||  access  |||  to finance and reducing the administrative burden on business .
|||  america  |||  , by contrast , seems to have an abundance of all the things europe lacks .
president - in - office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , and mr president , you will understand that , before i refer specifically to the item on the  |||  agenda  |||  which brought me here today , i should like , on behalf of the portuguese government and the portuguese presidency of the council , to thank you for such a warm and friendly tribute - so well deserved in my opinion - which you paid upon the such unexpected and sad loss of my fellow countryman and member of this parliament , dr fausto correia .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  that surveillance of the economic policies of the member states should be broadened beyond budgetary surveillance to prevent excessive macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities within the union .
in writing . - i am opposed to extremism in any form , but i do not accept that the british people must take  |||  advice  |||  from the eu on this - or indeed on any other matter .
i fear that the application of this directive at a regional and local level could work against deregulation measures and impede attempts to simplify administrative procedures , especially as its application may involve  |||  additional  |||  resources , the contribution of structural funds and other instruments being essential to make up for this during the transition period .
|||  american  |||  leaders will welcome her election as proof that the estrangement in bilateral relations is over .
there is an  |||  alternative  |||  to spending so much to achieve so little .
|||  across  |||  africa , these approaches often aim for a " win_win " outcome : the poor benefit and resources are conserved .
it is also my earnest wish to see montenegro finally create the national  |||  agency  |||  that will let the country enable its students and trainees to take part in the erasmus and leonardo education programmes .
however , as a result of human  |||  activity  |||  , the process of biodiversity loss around the world is advancing with increasing speed .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the third package of measures for the internal energy market must be coordinated with the copenhagen agreement in order to achieve energy security , promote renewable energy , and capture and store carbon dioxide .
the institutions ' transparency and the clarity of their representatives '  |||  actions  |||  should be an intrinsic element of real and genuine democracy .
see the offer of the locations for shooting that can be rented for taking a movie of shooting fashion or  |||  advertising  |||  photos .
i do not mind another view ,  |||  another  |||  attitude , as long as it does not lay claim to me , as long as i am not attacked for thinking differently .
we cannot , however , view the association  |||  agreement  |||  from a purely economic perspective ; the importance of the political dimension of the agreement needs to be stressed .
do you not need to  |||  address  |||  the problem of climate change denial if you are to raise our ambitions ?
politically , no european country can - or really wants to - adopt the  |||  american  |||  model .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing discharge of the 2008 budget , but discharge is always an opportunity to look  |||  ahead  |||  and i feel that in this context in particular , we must focus on the many agencies that we have introduced .
if a mass  |||  accident  |||  occurs due to the reckless and risky management practices of the company in charge , the legal entity can rightly be held accountable .
however , it is lacking one critical and ,  |||  above  |||  all , self - critical analysis .
as i understand they are especially interested in the commission and the international organisations that are providing them with help giving them sme market access so that they can  |||  actually  |||  make use of the access to the european market .
i therefore cannot  |||  accept  |||  that nabucco will pose a challenge to projects such as south stream and , to some extent , nord stream , whose aim is to supply gas directly from russia to a european union member state , thereby ensuring that the european union is not dependent on transit supplies through countries which are both politically and economically unstable .
in these areas ,  |||  afghanistan  |||  and pakistan will need our support for a very , very long time to come .
at the copenhagen session of the climate change conference at the end of 2009 , europe should be the leading force in negotiations on ambitious and comprehensive  |||  agreement  |||  for the post - kyoto period . this is one more reason to adopt the agreement as soon as possible in 2009 .
|||  although  |||  i feel that some of you are a little pessimistic about the progress that has been made , i want to approach this from a more positive side .
i would like to stress that , in my view , the biggest challenge facing the european union is  |||  actually  |||  the sense of solidarity between europeans from the old countries and new countries , in other words , the solidarity between europeans from east and west .
we should remember that this initiative is part of a package which  |||  aims  |||  to stimulate failing european economies .
in particular the commission should provide greater visibility over projects financed by the european union for reconstruction in iraq in 2006 ; for example , it should list the projects , what they are , the anticipated costs , and the  |||  agencies  |||  involved .
on 14 june 2010 , the commission published its  |||  action  |||  plan on global navigation satellite systems ( gnss ) , which included 24 specific recommendations for action .
the levels and differences of consumer prices between the member states are also monitored in the  |||  annual  |||  report of the consumer markets scoreboard .
literary researchers today may consider themselves to be the subject of literary history , and feel responsible only for their own reputation  |||  among  |||  other researchers ; but let us try to admit that the ultimate point of thinking about history is to help form the memory of a supra - individual collective known as the nation .
that will allow member states -  |||  allow  |||  , not oblige - to include external environment costs in tolls if they wish , and not just infrastructure costs , as is the case currently .
when we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble  |||  ahead  |||  .
health results cannot be  |||  achieved  |||  without adequate investment in the systems that deliver better health .
you do have a chance , however , for  |||  another  |||  30 seconds if you agree to answer a blue card question by mr van dalen .
i am voting for this partnership and cooperation agreement establishing a partnership between the european communities and their member states , of the one part , and ukraine , of the other part , on the general principles for the participation of ukraine in union programmes , and i welcome it because it is  |||  another  |||  step in pursuing the objectives that guided the creation of the common market .
otherwise , we would vote against all the  |||  amendments  |||  put forward .
in 2007  |||  alone  |||  , 75 ats laboratories were seized in china .
the  |||  administration  |||  did launch a modest regulatory - reform initiative in summer 2009 , proposing new consumer protections and some measures to strengthen financial stability , but the measures were fought every inch of the way . and early in 2010 a new bank tax was proposed that aimed to raise about $ 90 billion over a decade or so -- but that would have represented only about 1 % of banks ' profits .
food scandals occur time and  |||  again  |||  and not even the new legislation will prevent this , as no european rules are designed to prevent criminal activity ; but these rules will help ensure that , when these scandals do occur , it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in .
we express our solidarity with the people of burma and demand that the arrested protesters be released immediately and that http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991 be  |||  allowed  |||  to live a rewarding life and have freedom of action .
i also regret the stance of certain fellow members who , knowing in advance that a particular proposal would not be  |||  adopted  |||  , placed the burden of doing something ' politically incorrect ' on others , and still others who ' preferred ' not to participate in voting on the three amendments in question , despite participating in all the voting before and after them .
all older children or  |||  adults  |||  are charged nok 190.00 per night and person for extra beds .
this will change after the new legislation is implemented , which will  |||  allow  |||  special services to interfere in the activities of the media , close down editorial sections and control the printed or spoken word .
subject : eu earthquake policy :  |||  actions  |||  taken by the commission in the wake of the recent catastrophic earthquake in italy
|||  although  |||  the directive will apply to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes , i think that this provision goes too far , because such vehicles mainly operate regionally , and this should not be regulated at european level .
i congratulate him on these  |||  amendments  |||  and i sincerely hope that the commission will change its opinion and that it will pay greater attention to what our rapporteur has said .
we all share the goal of a more open , transparent china adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to  |||  address  |||  global challenges .
but a $ 3 billion investment by the chinese swf in the us investment firm blackstone suggests a more worryingly strategic investment policy , one that appears  |||  aimed  |||  at advancing its own industrial interests in certain markets .
in order to improve  |||  access  |||  to financial resources for poorer groups in the eligible countries , an additional grant of eur 500 million should be allocated to the eib immediately to finance micro - credits .

as the content of the renewed agreement will be identical to the content of the  |||  agreement  |||  which expires on 20 february 2009 , there would be no sense in continuing talks on the renewal of this agreement in the usual manner .

it is unfortunate that during the many months -  |||  almost  |||  one year - that have passed since the first discussion of the dossier in committee , interinstitutional negotiations have not made any progress .

i do not like bullfighting or cockfighting either but these are , believe it or not ,  |||  allowed  |||  in some parts of the eu on the grounds of national culture , so if iceland joins the eu , it must be allowed - in my personal view - to safeguard its whaling industry if it insists on so doing .

whilst i wholeheartedly agree that rising energy prices require affirmative political  |||  action  |||  , i reject the resolution 's references to ' low carbon ' energy . i reject the idea that increased nuclear energy can have a positive impact on the environment and believe that political attention should be focused on non - nuclear renewable energy sources .
true , there were differences  |||  among  |||  countries , but most observers regarded them as less important relative to the common challenges .
the hotel enjoys good  |||  access  |||  to the motorway network , just 1.2 km away , and is also very central ( 1.2 km from the city centre ) .
of the advocated measures , i would stress : effective and flexible meat - market mechanisms ; combating speculation on cereals and the creation of a safety net in this sector ;  |||  adequate  |||  protection of farm workers in the most disadvantaged areas , and greater power for producer organisations .
competition  |||  among  |||  nations and among peoples trumps cooperation , and regional and global conflicts obstruct the pathways to a sustainable future .
this represents a welcome development at a time when the irish government has introduced a new  |||  airport  |||  tax which will discriminate against beleaguered smaller regional airports to the advantage of the already congested dublin airport .
it therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment ,  |||  adequate  |||  social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all eu policies .
we are now in the third year following the financial crisis and i am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package - that would , of course , be an  |||  additional  |||  measure - or whether we have to expect that , by the weekend , yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others .
" this is the future of search engines  |||  according  |||  to one of the leading experts on search engines that italy and europe know .
we need to seek allies  |||  among  |||  those with whom we share common values and common interests , and not among those who are very far from us .
in  |||  addition  |||  , nuclear energy reduces a country 's dependency on the supply of fuel from unstable territories .
first , the european parliament must take into  |||  account  |||  the real economic situation in the member states - the fact that , in most states of the european union , the economy is either declining or stagnating , and that in only a few countries is it growing .
in any case , in order to have an appropriate structure to the text , i would like to table the following oral amendment , in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs . amendments 1 , 3 and 4 are to be moved after paragraph 32 , amendment 5 after recital m , and  |||  amendment  |||  6 after recital q. this is just the replacement of that .
in this regard , i thank the rapporteur for including in the compromise  |||  amendments  |||  requests relating to the particular challenges facing the outermost regions in terms of accessibility and competitiveness , which are vital aspects of territorial cohesion .
|||  additional  |||  environmental criteria are simply not included .
moreover , for the future discharge procedures , the director of each eu  |||  agency  |||  should make available to parliament its report from the internal audit service .
it should also be highlighted that the ' package ' will facilitate  |||  access  |||  for people with disabilities to telecommunications services .
the rhetoric from the fund has been ambitious , including at the recently concluded  |||  annual  |||  meeting of its shareholders -- the world 's central banks and finance ministries -- in washington .
i believe that the government of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has made significant progress in 2009 , as is also highlighted in the resolution on the 2009  |||  activity  |||  report .
as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy , we should focus ,  |||  among  |||  other things , on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation .
i understand that the rapporteur agrees with this oral  |||  amendment  |||  .
the commission is currently implementing a preparatory  |||  action  |||  in the field of sport in order to prepare future eu actions in accordance with the budgetary decisions taken by parliament , and the 2009 preparatory action has already provided a clear indication about the high interest in the area of hepa , with 64 % of the applications for the action being in this area .
the economic crash in the united kingdom is at least as severe as in  |||  america  |||  , forcing the government to rely almost entirely on deficit spending to prevent a complete meltdown of its financial system .
we can only encourage them to do this under the terms of the treaty , which have never been revised and which are useful terms  |||  allowing  |||  europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .
obviously we can talk here about monitoring , about controls on imports from china , but let us not forget something known as re - export , which is where china sends certain items to , for example , african countries , and those items then come to us as african products ,  |||  although  |||  really they are products made in chinese factories located in those countries , or actually manufactured in china .
olmert , defense minister ehud barak , and foreign minister tzippi livni have cast aside their political rivalries in order to orchestrate an  |||  answer  |||  : israel must fight off the gazan rockets .
i welcome the fact that the report deals with the unfair treatment of prisoners in the  |||  american  |||  detention facility at guantánamo .
in addition , since the total number of cattle herds and sheep flocks  |||  affected  |||  by the disease increased from 695 in 2006 to 6 857 in 2007 in belgium alone , would the commission state what measures it intends to introduce for the development of an antiviral treatment , for vaccination campaigns , and for the financing of the foregoing ?
however , its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into  |||  account  |||  a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country .
the presidency confirms that the council does in fact carry out a six - monthly review of the situation as regards implementation of the eu counter - terrorism strategy and of the strategy against terrorist financing and an  |||  annual  |||  evaluation of the implementation of the strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism .
we also need to emphasise the possibility of a fast - track procedure , which reduces the time needed for  |||  administration  |||  , and it is also important that veterinarians thus have much more rapid access to the medicinal products .
while the increase in revenue is largely due to the vat and gni balances , budgetary under - implementation is mainly responsible for the significant reduction in expenditure , with the cuts essentially  |||  affecting  |||  the headings of cohesion , fisheries , environment and agriculture .
in  |||  addition  |||  , there is supervision of maintenance .
therefore , i am in favour of the debate going ahead , albeit voicing my regret once  |||  again  |||  that the council is absent .
thus , the election results should not be viewed primarily as an endorsement of the republicans , but as a rebuke to the democrats '  |||  agenda  |||  , which voters believed was out of touch with their concerns , interests , and values .
thirdly , i  |||  agree  |||  with the commissions proposal to use mixtures of natural gas and hydrogen , but only as a transition fuel and only in countries that have a well - developed natural gas infrastructure .
given that , in the already extensive relations between the eu and the principality of andorra , this is another positive step towards possible integration into the internal market and that , as well as including rules to ensure that the  |||  agreement  |||  and the eu acquis remain in alignment , it aims to ensure customs security and normal relations between both parties , i welcome the adoption of this recommendation , for which i voted .
promoting the flexibility and security model gives employers a strong weapon with which to increase temporary  |||  agency  |||  work , which results in less favourable working conditions and waters down collective agreements .
he was an apologist for  |||  american  |||  power , even though during the vietnam years he had wriggled and dodged to avoid being at the sharp , conscripted end of it .
the presidency is also aware of the widely - shared consensus among the member states that short - , medium - and long - term solutions be  |||  adopted  |||  without delay that would prevent similar situations from recurring in the future .
thank you , commissioner , for your  |||  answer  |||  .
the delay in carrying out a number of  |||  activities  |||  calls into question the principle of budgetary annuality , which has caused the carryover of budgetary appropriations .
we support  |||  action  |||  against undeclared work , but we have to abstain from voting because this proposal has serious shortcomings .
at the end of 2008 ,  |||  almost  |||  17 % of the european population - that is , 85 million people - were living below the poverty line .
from now on ,  |||  alternative  |||  investment funds ( hedge funds ) entering europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by europe .

|||  americans  |||  are from italy , europeans are from japan
this proposal does not alter the content of the codified legal acts ; it only joins these  |||  acts  |||  together , following the necessary amendments for codification .
entrepreneurship , training , flexibility , smart regulation and  |||  access  |||  to credit are the key words of the small business act , a framework that defines the eu policy for smes through targeted assistance and training activities for young people .
commissioner , we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises , written texts which are extremely interesting and with which i  |||  agree  |||  almost 100 % .
it is not just about those who are facing conviction and the death penalty but , along with them , all the many others that are  |||  affected  |||  , their families and so many other people in society , simply because those people face execution without any opportunity of a fair trial .
there is another element which is essential for the consistency of the exercise : the use of common definitions for the capital thresholds  |||  according  |||  to which the participating banks will be assessed .
the debate on the transfer of passenger name records and the difficulty with the pnr  |||  agreement  |||  and its legal basis have been enough to show us that there is simply no such thing as balanced negotiations on these issues .
( the speaker  |||  agreed  |||  to take a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
the aim of the new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the partnership  |||  agreement  |||  in the fisheries sector between the european community and the union of the comoros is to strengthen the partnership and cooperation in the fisheries sector using all the available financial instruments .
in  |||  addition  |||  , tracing firearms is of the greatest importance in the fight against organised crime .
to conclude , the awareness campaign on the importance of this year and cultural dialogue encompasses in itself a vast range of  |||  activities  |||  aimed at young people , based on proposals by civil associations and eu initiatives .
i realise that it is difficult for the commissioner to reach true  |||  agreement  |||  on this under the unanimity rule .
for that reason , the commission needs to provide information as to the  |||  actual  |||  costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts , and i do not think that the refusal that i have just heard from the commission is acceptable .
does this negotiating mandate also provide for a general  |||  agreement  |||  on personal data protection ?
meps have therefore called for universal  |||  access  |||  to affordable healthcare to be improved .
( cs ) madam president , in the debate on the ce marking yesterday i drew the attention of the commission yet  |||  again  |||  to the fact that registration of the ce marking has still not been initiated , although it has been enshrined in european legislation for 16 years now and i asked for it in parliamentary interpellation three months ago .
it is futile for the bush  |||  administration  |||  to deny it .
against this background , the commission remains confident that the european union aid levels will increase  |||  again  |||  as of 2008 - this year .
i would like to appeal strongly here to mrs malmström to ensure that coordination between member states on security will be equally as good as it has been until now , and once  |||  again  |||  , i would like to thank mr coelho very much for a splendid report .
|||  another  |||  issue raised once again is the easy option : blame the cap - as if the cap were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world .
to name but one : after a re - examination of procurement by the european network and information security  |||  agency  |||  more weaknesses were found in this area .
it was , as we all remember , a very serious railway  |||  accident  |||  .
europe must take collective  |||  action  |||  to overcome the current situation .
let us look at  |||  actions  |||  , not words .
we must make sure that we play our part in the eu ensuring that the hungry  |||  across  |||  the world are fed .
moreover , the automakers are essential for closing the trade deficit , and their demise could bring  |||  another  |||  surge in imports .
the imf and world bank would offer  |||  advice  |||  , expertise , and financing , with the fund concentrating on the macroeconomic and financial stability that is crucial to fostering durable growth and poverty reduction .
if we now start cutting corners to the detriment of social services , education and training and ,  |||  above  |||  all , child care , then that will have implications for the future and for the livelihoods of women .
this hotel is just 50 metres away from nuremberg  |||  airport  |||  and 20 metres from the underground station taking guests into nuremberg city centre in only 12 minutes .
( bg ) first of all , mr strasser , i would like to say that i cannot  |||  agree  |||  that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used .
the licensing procedure via the food safety authority is excellent , but what bothers me - and here i should like to ask the commission to have a rethink - is that we are giving the food safety authority nine months for authorisation or risk  |||  analysis  |||  .
while i believe this technology might help industry to reduce co2 emissions , i cannot  |||  accept  |||  that european taxpayers ' money be used to finance the development of a ccs infrastructure that will be someone 's business in the end .
it underscored , however , that their recovery was still somewhat fragile and called on the committee of european banking supervisors to provide regular information on the  |||  amount  |||  of capital available for additional borrowing .
i absolutely  |||  agree  |||  with the points that have been made in respect of the national standards institutes .
it must be possible to  |||  allow  |||  a bank to fail whilst still protecting customers .
in writing . - i supported the compromise package and rejected those  |||  amendments  |||  seeking to extend the transitional period for the " repair clause " .
the fact that turkmenistan borders  |||  afghanistan  |||  makes it also a strategically important country .
it is only by making a joint effort that we will be able to  |||  address  |||  the social and health consequences of dementia and provide services and support for people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases , as well as for their families .
can you witness , with a clear conscience , the staggering increase in unemployment figures which have now reached millions in the european union , and the shameless rewards  |||  again  |||  being paid out by the financial sector to those who have not only plunged us into the worst crisis imaginable , but also threatened us with poverty ?
speaking of social policy , which has been mentioned here on many occasions , i  |||  agree  |||  : yes , it should be one of the main priorities on our agenda , but it should be active too .
the second analogy , to the old balance - of - power system in europe , is especially popular among israeli and  |||  american  |||  diplomats .
( pl ) madam president , today one of the most important challenges facing the union is the creation of an effective mechanism for project coordination and information exchange  |||  among  |||  participants in afghanistan .
|||  although  |||  the islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post - arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction .
this is something we shall repeat  |||  again  |||  and again when we are in malaysia and the asean states , and the european parliament will underline this with this resolution .
furthermore , the european union and russia are currently negotiating a new contractual basis to replace the existing partnership and cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  .
|||  almost  |||  half of my customers bought avs device in order to ease sleep onset or improve quality of sleep .
the eu and russia are mutually interdependent , both economically and politically , and therefore , the conclusion of a strategic partnership  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu and the russian federation is particularly important for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners .
room service ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , currency exchange , bicycle rental , packed lunches , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
i would like also to come back to  |||  amendment  |||  138/46 and to make clear the meaning and scope of the text underpinning the agreement of parliament and of the council , the so - called ' last chance compromise ' .
the fact that we are essentially using research funds is totally  |||  acceptable  |||  , but it is absolutely right to seek new funding opportunities , for this project as well as for galileo for example , partly in the context of surplus budgeted funds , funds that have not been spent , and partly with new commitments by the individual member states .
it is very important that an ambitious and legally binding  |||  agreement  |||  on climate change is reached at the copenhagen conference .
|||  another  |||  very important point is the use of more rigorous training and certification measures for all interested and responsible parties in the community railway market , from railway companies to infrastructure managers .
thirdly , do you  |||  agree  |||  with my conclusion that without consent to significant reductions in emissions from the usa , china , russia and india , the efforts of the european union , and the costs we are incurring , will be wasted ?
offer is limited  |||  according  |||  our capacity .
the five executive  |||  agencies  |||  have 176 posts .
i am delighted that my  |||  amendments  |||  relating to the unacceptable effects of plant protection products that could , among other things , have a negative impact on the behaviour of certain species such as bees and that could even lead to the extinction of these species , have been taken into consideration .

i conclude by calling for greater efforts to be made by the commission and the council to circulate the european union  |||  annual  |||  report on human rights .
we wish you well but we hope that you will be the first to resist the tabloid frankenstein food mythology and put in place some policies that will  |||  allow  |||  our farmers to compete internationally on a level playing field .
the sudanese government 's consent to the deployment of the hybrid united nations /  |||  african  |||  union mission , which aims to keep peace in the region , is of course a welcome development .
|||  allow  |||  me also to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
|||  above  |||  all , they are entitled to have their data in the electronic communications space protected .
on behalf of the uen group . - mr president , once a beacon of hope , an example of african self - empowerment and a leader among  |||  african  |||  states , zimbabwe is now the epicentre of african despair and hopelessness .
this directive which has been  |||  adopted  |||  today by the vast majority of the european parliament marks an important stage in achieving greater consumer protection within the european union .
the draft  |||  agreement  |||  was examined by the committee on transport and tourism , which issued a favourable opinion .
as i understand it , the central system is now once  |||  again  |||  being shelved .
please  |||  allow  |||  me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied , but they also give prestige to our institutions : parliament , the council and the european commission .
we cannot , as commissioner rehn said in the foreign affairs committee , just kindly ask  |||  again  |||  .
this had to be admitted , albeit reluctantly , even by the  |||  advocates  |||  of the old european constitution .
russia probably can tame the iranian regime , but it will do so only in exchange for  |||  america  |||  's respect for its interests in the former soviet republics , and possibly also a revision of post - cold war strategic agreements .
this text will enable patients to seek treatment more easily in  |||  another  |||  member state .
i  |||  agree  |||  with you - and sadly we have proof - that missing children are often used for organ trafficking .
i voted against that  |||  agreement  |||  , which was blocked by parliament out of concern for the privacy rights of european citizens and companies , put at risk by unregulated bulk data - sharing arrangements .
i welcome the institutional  |||  agreement  |||  that was reached with regard to the implementation of the bonus initiative on 27 april last .
finally , if the initial proposals for social benefits to immigrants are reduced , as other groups have  |||  achieved  |||  in the voting in committee , then i think it is necessary , even though we are currently in a period of crisis , to ensure effective access to the labour market .
i must appeal to the authorities who fail to penalise this and even fail to  |||  address  |||  it , because cutting down forests has become common practice in the czech republic .
we did say at that particular time that we would keep the activities of credit rating agencies on watch , and in 2007 , when the subprime crisis reached its peak , i met with the credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  and expressed our dissatisfaction as to how we perceived they had conducted their affairs .
i think it a great shame that the council is not present , as i believe that this house has  |||  again  |||  taken a very clear position on cloning , and indeed considers that this has no place in the present regulation and should , at all events , be the subject of open and public debate .
|||  allow  |||  me to convey the appreciation of the council to the european parliament for the excellent cooperation .
with the conclusion of this  |||  additional  |||  protocol , the lisbon agreement can enter into force , 20 years after it was signed .
the variety of proposals clearly shows that we need broader debate on the activities of the european investment bank and the direction in which those  |||  activities  |||  should be developed .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on fisheries . - ( pt ) i must start by expressing my regret that the committee on regional development has not included any of the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled by the committee on fisheries on the fourth cohesion report .
faced with the budgetary restrictions affecting all countries , parliament will only  |||  agree  |||  to extend its assistance if eu funds have really served to improve the security of energy supply , modernise infrastructure and develop sustainable energy projects .
in writing . - ( fr ) the un security council is  |||  again  |||  going to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions on iran for its nuclear activities .
in the long run , the us and eu should support civil society organizations in pressing moldova 's government to guarantee more equitable distribution of television time , to stop police harassment of opposition political leaders and workers as well as journalists , to reform the police and end the ruling party 's abuse of state institutions , and to  |||  allow  |||  all political parties more opportunity to inspect election rolls and monitor polling stations .
the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) was created to provide  |||  additional  |||  support to workers who are suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
national and regional authorities must take  |||  advantage  |||  of these opportunities and make intensive use of the structural funds in order to boost employment , smes , the spirit of enterprise and work - related training , whilst making their contribution under the cofinancing rules , so that the allocated funds can be utilised in full .
let us wait for them , and  |||  action  |||  will be taken on this matter as it was on parental leave : this is the right way to go .
on  |||  amendment  |||  8 , i accept the inclusion of a reference to seal mortality as an example , and of considerations of climate change on cod when a review of the plan is made .
i should also like to draw your attention to the risk inherent in amendment 205 , which envisages labelling meat derived from  |||  animals  |||  that have been ritually slaughtered .
also ,  |||  amendments  |||  that remove the obligation for accurate record - keeping in the user establishment were not supported .
|||  airport  |||  shuttle , laundry , dry cleaning , breakfast in the room , bridal suite , bicycle rental , car rental , fax / photocopying .
france 's global  |||  ambition  |||  is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro .
( bg ) mr. chairman , colleagues , on the eve of the launch of the ratification of the lisbon treaty and the signing of the chater of fundamental rights , i would like to draw your attention to bulgaria and to the fact that , unfortunately , the bulgarian government , its  |||  administration  |||  and the reprsentatives of the ruling coalition in parliament are still far away from the application of some of the underlying fundamental principles .
is this  |||  acceptable  |||  ?
the european union wants to tackle this issue much more profoundly and so , this naturally takes account of the issues you raise , which are closely linked to  |||  action  |||  by the european union in relation to the fight against climate change .
however , according to a new report which we received in the committee on the environment last year , less than 2 % of cdm projects are in  |||  african  |||  countries .
the code of practice which we are voting on requires that young people should be guaranteed safe  |||  access  |||  to the internet .
it must not drift off course to become or inspire intergovernmental  |||  action  |||  .
as the honourable member mentioned , ministers for the various sectors often  |||  adopt  |||  domestic measures without previously agreeing on the objectives to be attained , so that decision - making is rather ad hoc and random .
but the subsequent recovery has been anemic and sub - par in most  |||  advanced  |||  economies given painful deleveraging .
this popular , family - run holiday hotel enjoys an idyllic and very quiet location  |||  above  |||  the village of wilderswil , with an wonderful view of the eiger , mönch and jungfrau mountains and of lake brienz .
if you look at what we agreed in the davies report and in the cars 21 report , where we  |||  actually  |||  want to start legislating in 2015 , the substance of the commission proposal has on the whole been safeguarded and there is a balance between social , ecological and economic criteria .
it has also become painfully clear that the member states are showing an ever - decreasing  |||  amount  |||  of solidarity when they have to contend with a crisis , and it is precisely european solidarity that is the first value to be lost when savings have to be made in national budgets .
the bush administration 's response to the hurricane confirmed the suspicion among blacks that , while they might send their boys to fight  |||  america  |||  's wars , they had not only been left behind in america 's prosperity , but that there was neither understanding nor concern when they needed it most .
then it was  |||  american  |||  troops and arms that liberated western europe from nazism .
there is also something quite new in  |||  advertising  |||  , which is not covered by the texts .
meanwhile , the proposal insists on increasing allocations for external  |||  action  |||  , to provide resources compatible with the eu 's ambitions .
moreover , the commission is also financing initiatives  |||  aimed  |||  at ensuring that darfurian society is involved in and committed to the process of conflict resolution .
however , we must ensure that eu - level  |||  action  |||  does not encroach on the principle of subsidiarity .
the opening of accession negotiations was  |||  agreed  |||  unanimously , and that means that france agreed to it as well .
ever since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year , the regime -- once central to american strategic interests in the region , has been made to feel dispensable by the us , which drops strong hints that there are  |||  alternatives  |||  to saudi military bases , even to saudi oil .
this would , in any case , send a positive signal as to our intention to take the measures necessary to address the important economic challenge  |||  ahead  |||  of us .
different sources of information are used to monitor and assess the compliance of operators with international safety standards ; namely , the safety audits carried out by the international civil aviation organisation , the information provided by competent authorities of third countries , the information provided by the european aviation safety agency in the framework of its inspections and investigations within the european union or technical missions outside the european union , the results of the ramp checks carried out on aircraft or air carriers at eu airports in the framework of the safety assessment of foreign aircraft programme ,  |||  according  |||  to the requirements of the relevant eu rules , and , finally , substantiated accident - related information stemming from accident or serious incident investigation reports .
there should certainly be clearer distinctions made between advertising and information , even though direct  |||  advertising  |||  of prescription drugs to consumers will remain prohibited under the relevant proposals .
the commission , too , had doubts about how long we would  |||  actually  |||  persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , shoe shine , packed lunches , fax / photocopying .
following the formal creation of the european  |||  agency  |||  for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union ( frontex ) , it has become necessary to make the best possible use of union border resources .
under the visa waiver programme , passengers travelling to the united states by air or sea will have to  |||  answer  |||  certain questions online before departure .
with this in mind , i am pleased to gather from mr belder 's most comprehensive report that there is constructive cooperation with the eu on the question of  |||  afghanistan  |||  in order to increase security and stability in this region .
thirdly , we believe it is important that , when other measures are taken in this region , whether these are  |||  additional  |||  car parks or other developments , a special screening of the entire project is carried out which includes existing developed areas and existing building projects .
certainly , according to sharon 's thinking , there is no future for 9,000 jewish settlers living  |||  among  |||  1.2 million palestinians in the gaza strip .
anwar 's bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement , as growing anti - umno and anti - mahathir sentiments took hold  |||  among  |||  islamic - minded malays .
many emerging markets have run current -  |||  account  |||  surpluses for the first time .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , currency exchange , packed lunches , car rental , fax / photocopying .
the fact that agreement was  |||  achieved  |||  at second reading is particularly gratifying .
however , the management of peugeot / citroen in mangualde currently wishes to destroy rights that were fought for and are enshrined in the labour laws by pressuring the workers to  |||  accept  |||  harmful conditions that endanger their lives .
it will be in the best position to take  |||  action  |||  since , rightly or wrongly , the americans are considered to have sided with the israelis , and the arabs , with the palestinians .
it is important to establish a level playing field for scientists from all eu member states , to provide equal payment for research  |||  activities  |||  , without dividing scientists according to their country 's standard of living , because scientific progress is a matter for the whole of the european union , not just individual countries .
meanwhile , vertical farm experiments -- which aim to augment urban food supplies by cultivating crops in skyscraper greenhouses -- are proliferating from the  |||  american  |||  midwest to osaka , japan .
europe 2020 must not trigger  |||  another  |||  competition marathon and privatisation exodus .

we need to be clear on this : human beings have a right to life from the moment the egg and the sperm fuse until their natural death , and this  |||  amendment  |||  fundamentally brings that right to life into question .
mr president , i would like to support the original  |||  amendment  |||  by my colleague , james elles , who has proposed a new paragraph which declares that the eu recognises the substantial contribution to the protection of the eu from long - range ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned deployment of the european - based us missile defence assets .

above all , the ' goal of a largely decarbonised transportation system by 2050 ' that is mentioned in the report , must involve significantly increasing development of various types of mass and public transport and promoting their use to make them  |||  accessible  |||  to all ; electric vehicles must be strongly represented in this process .
it should be noted that , as a general rule , democracy , governance and human rights are no longer taboo , and many  |||  african  |||  countries have embarked on the road to progress , as they say , not in response to europe 's expectations , but in response to the expectations of their own people .
i welcome the  |||  agreement  |||  reached on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council concerning statistics on pesticides which will allow for the creation of a legal framework and the establishment of harmonised rules for the collection and dissemination of statistics on the sale and use of pesticides , with a view to the sustainable use of the latter .

we are negotiating an  |||  agreement  |||  in which the subject of energy is essential ; these negotiations are beginning , and we have the best prospects for them , but obviously , like all agreements , it is something that depends on very complex negotiations that are , in turn , part of a series of negotiations on this cooperation agreement that we want to update - as i said - because a great deal has happened in europe in the past 15 or 20 years .
the europe that inspired the work and thinking of the founding fathers , not a europe of bureaucracy , very often and in my view almost  |||  always  |||  , deaf to the voice from the real economy .

the free movement of goods or a reduced customs duty  |||  allow  |||  a greater flow of capital and facilitate cooperation agreements .
that is the plea i make : that europe should  |||  again  |||  turn more of its attention to these countries .
in austria , we have a saying , and it goes as follows : ' does something  |||  always  |||  have to happen before something happens ? '
i would stress the need for the russian authorities to respond to this attack using a legal and moderate means , and to  |||  allow  |||  the russian judicial system to operate freely and independently to try and sentence those responsible for the attack .

|||  although  |||  supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries , the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries , and rightly so .
i regard that as  |||  added  |||  value .
we have  |||  achieved  |||  great success in managing to give a clear expression of support for use of the community approach as the main form of cooperation within the mechanism .
this is apparent from the fact that , yet  |||  again  |||  , the council is absent from this very important debate , despite the fact that as the second arm of the budgetary authority , it should be concerned about what is happening to the taxpayers ' money , which it is responsible for managing and disbursing .
i propose that the future european medicinal web portal recently created by the pharmacovigilance directive be used as a central point to  |||  access  |||  information .

next , people called by the activists as witnesses are not being  |||  allowed  |||  to appear in court to testify and make it a fair trial .
the figure i stated earlier does not include all those who sit waiting to see what their fate may be , many of whom are  |||  actually  |||  innocent and have been denied the possibility of a fair trial .
we can achieve this through a ' european reflex ' , provided we mobilise community funds without bureaucratic delay ;  |||  adopt  |||  and enforce strict environmental legislation to protect forests and ecosystems ; establish an independent european rapid - response team ; and implement a european strategy to combat the impact of climate change .
i also  |||  agree  |||  with the effective application of a european rapid - intervention capability .

new negotiations began in january 2009 with the willing andean countries , namely columbia , ecuador and peru , in order to reach a multilateral free trade  |||  agreement  |||  .
in addition , the speed with which the  |||  amendments  |||  were announced seems to suggest that these will not be substantive revisions , but only cosmetic changes , and that is not acceptable by any standard .
therefore , in drawing up this proposal , we have tried to take into  |||  account  |||  industrial sensitivities in the eu , especially as regards textiles .
as something essential to social development and combating poverty , early years learning should be founded on the guarantee of a pre - school network that is public , free , high quality and  |||  accessible  |||  to all .
i believe that the schedule presented here by the commission is a good one , as it requires the industry to come to a voluntary  |||  agreement  |||  by april or be subject to technical legislation .
therefore , i think it is absolutely vital that all members of this parliament urge the commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that i mean proposals which would allow every region across europe that qualifies , to  |||  access  |||  structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future .
through the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled , we have called for education and vocational training plans to maintain and develop the expertise and skills required for spent fuel and radioactive waste management .
but an even greater problem is the fact that there is also still no  |||  agreement  |||  on whether unmik 's powers should be handed over to eulex .
|||  allow  |||  me to make a few short remarks .
we believe that the main objective of the european urban  |||  agenda  |||  is to serve the development and qualitative updating of the infrastructure and services in european cities .

moreover , this solution has been  |||  accepted  |||  by customs representatives associations , even though they have lost their monopoly in certain member states .
to achieve these goals , the g - 8 should set clear timetables for  |||  action  |||  , and transparent agreements on how to fund it .
he , a british citizen , was able to take  |||  advantage  |||  of the excellent health - care service in belgium .

i am voting for this report , which  |||  aims  |||  to reduce the protein deficit in the eu , and i hope that its recommendations , such as support for farmers intending to opt for protein crops and practice crop rotation , will be taken into account when the new cap is being drawn up .
so far , the recommendations  |||  adopted  |||  by the gfcm have been transposed into eu legislation on a provisional basis , by means of annual regulations on fishing possibilities .

i personally believe that if we guarantee temporary agency workers the same conditions enjoyed by workers from user companies , we are not only protecting temporary  |||  agency  |||  workers but , above all , local permanent staff .
in our  |||  amendments  |||  we have highlighted the importance of giving special consideration to remote and isolated regions .
if we look at what the europeans have actually already done in terms of an efficient climate policy for reducing co2 emissions , what has  |||  actually  |||  been achieved , the reduction targets we have set , the legislation in our climate package , none of that is sufficient to achieve the two - degree target that is constantly talked about .
we all think we know the history of europe and so it is perhaps uncomfortable to hear that the europe we know is  |||  actually  |||  only one part of europe , as norman davies - that great historian of europe - has so effectively shown .
the obligation to include  |||  among  |||  them the countries of central asia and mongolia appears comprehensible only as an effort to unite under one umbrella states regarded by the rapporteurs as places of similar geopolitical importance , presumably as potential platforms against russia and china .
that is  |||  another  |||  task for the commission .
this action plan will propose several areas of  |||  action  |||  to tackle the main challenges posed by this phenomenon , which affects unaccompanied minors arriving in the european union in different contexts , and will be guided by the best interests of the child .
it is precisely this kind of macho reasoning that led  |||  america  |||  to war in iraq in the first place .

i therefore urge you , prime - minister , to support the initiatives of the parliamentt and the european commission concerning free  |||  access  |||  to the labour market .
for example , malta , ireland and the united kingdom are requesting that pet dogs and cats be subject to  |||  additional  |||  examinations for ticks , which must also be certified in their animal passports .
i have two brief technical comments : on the question of publication , members have said and i too shall add that it is absolutely fair and absolutely right for the member states in which  |||  access  |||  to the internet is severely limited to be given the facility , alongside the general rule of electronic publication , of publication in the press for obvious social and financial reasons .
this report , and every other initiative on this issue , will have no value in the future unless all of us , especially those of us who are directly elected by the citizens of europe , highlight in every policy , in every pillar of our  |||  action  |||  , the priority and emphasis which we need to give to young people .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur 's proposal to strengthen the ' territorial cooperation ' objective by increasing the overall budget from 2.5 % to 7 % , adopting measures to simplify the implementation of programmes and creating european groupings of territorial cooperation ( egtcs ) , which are essential to the functioning of cross - border governance systems .
we also welcome the proposal on ' new skills for new jobs ' , and trust this really will link in with the climate change  |||  agenda  |||  , which also needs to look at new skills in old jobs , because most of the workforce have now passed the stage of formal education , making lifelong learning crucial .
the  |||  agency  |||  must inform the european parliament of the actions taken to improve the programming and monitoring of its contracts , in order to avoid , in future , the deficiencies reported by the court of auditors .
in such circumstances , the fight against terrorism and piracy should be based  |||  above  |||  all on the elimination of poverty and destitution by humanitarian aid to the poorest and facilitation of development .
in its conclusions last december , the council acknowledged the progress referred to by the commission and  |||  agreed  |||  to return to the matter in the next few months .
my original  |||  amendment  |||  to paragraph 87 aimed to confirm , rather than merely recognise , nato 's role as the bedrock for collective defence - a role which is not just ' still continuing ' but should be seen as the only option for the foreseeable future .
i am decidedly against the rapporteur 's approach , and also believe that to call for a change in the directive without the requisite  |||  analysis  |||  at member state level , particularly in those member states affected by the judgment of the european court of justice , is an unreasonable step taken for political ends .
the agreement takes  |||  account  |||  of the needs and conditions of the various regions of the community , which differ in terms of natural environment and climate .
however , please  |||  allow  |||  me to say that all of us in this chamber - all members of the european parliament , and i am sure this also includes the president of the commission and mr lópez garrido on behalf of the council - would like , once again , to express enormous solidarity with the greek nation .
i believe that we have taken the first correct step through our proposal to provide eur 2.6 billion in a first step , to raise the ceiling for the year 2009 for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by an  |||  amount  |||  of eur 2 billion , to lower the ceiling of heading 2 by the same amount , and to provide eur 600 million for rural development .
i trust that the  |||  adopted  |||  text will apply to all sectors and not just to agriculture .
the financing of such  |||  actions  |||  should also reflect this .
i would like to amend my vote on  |||  amendments  |||  13 and 14 - it should have been a minus not a plus .
|||  although  |||  critical to china 's goals of modernization and globalization , the internet threatens the political status quo .
( fr ) mr president , the rapporteur , mr corbett ,  |||  actually  |||  expressed his views , using offensive language , i might add , outside the constitutional affairs committee regarding the political family of which i am one of the representatives in this house ; this clearly gives rise to serious doubts as to his impartiality .
i voted to  |||  adopt  |||  this resolution , while also taking into account the further themes which will be dealt with after the pilot project has been assessed .
on march 18th five years ago , castro 's government cracked down on the varela project and other civil society initiatives rather than risk allowing a spark of democratic reform to spread  |||  across  |||  cuba as it had in the former soviet bloc . the seventy five prisoners of conscience locked up were dissidents , independent journalists , leaders from civil society , and librarians , who had dared to speak the truth openly about what life is like in cuba . even though four prisoners have recently been released , fifty five of the seventy five remain incarcerated in deplorable conditions . in general , the only reason that any of these prisoners were freed was because of how seriously their health had deteriorated .
moreover , parliament appreciates in this sense the improved procedure put in place by the commission , following parliament 's request for accelerating the release of grants ,  |||  aimed  |||  at presenting to the budgetary authority the commission 's assessment on the eligibility of an egf application together with the proposal to mobilise the fund and hopes that further improvements in the procedure will be reached in the framework of the upcoming reviews of the fund .
the  |||  above  |||  mentioned advantages do emerge after the payment of the one - time agio .
among other examples , it  |||  aims  |||  for greater liberalisation of health care , water distribution , education , cultural services , tourism or financial services .
germany 's welfare system effectively creates a minimum wage for the low skilled that is so far  |||  above  |||  the market price that it effectively prices such workers out of jobs .
indeed , while everyone knows that each eu member state has its own laws , legal traditions , and codes , here we have yet  |||  another  |||  assault by these fanatical euro - federalists , in the shape of their desire to create a ' european judicial culture ' .
what is on the table for the so - called reform of the stability and growth pact is no great answer ; once  |||  again  |||  , it is the lowest common denominator - the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon .
this was very promising since  |||  almost  |||  all packages build on this architecture without problems using the pristine debian sarge sources .
we do not want just fine words ; we want  |||  action  |||  , so that this summer we will not be mourning the victims of major ecological disasters .
as we see , we have  |||  achieved  |||  a broad consensus in favour .
in  |||  addition  |||  , consumer protection levels should not be impaired by the dismantling of barriers .
thus i am very glad that this text was  |||  agreed  |||  at first reading , since urgent progress must be made in this field .
i would like to add that this is also on  |||  account  |||  of social exclusion .
light pine - taiga is formed mainly by pinus sylvestris and is  |||  almost  |||  without herbal and bryophyte undergrowth .
|||  although  |||  it would be best if these options were adopted by the un security council , the eu itself can and must act to increase the costs to the sudanese government of its continued obstruction of aid deliveries and its delaying tactics on deployment of international peacekeepers .
this crisis was largely a result of  |||  america  |||  's effort to bolster an economy weakened by vastly increased inequality , through low interest rates and lax regulation ( both of which resulted in many people borrowing far beyond their means ) .
i also applaud this report for calling on the member states to  |||  adopt  |||  measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members , predominantly women , of all ages in caring for older and younger members , in the context of solidarity between generations .
for  |||  almost  |||  a year now , since the expiration of the original start treaty in december 2009 , no us inspectors have been on the ground in russia to verify the state of its nuclear arsenal .
i feel i have to mention  |||  amendment  |||  2 , which sharply criticises pope benedict xvi .
the contentious issue now is products from cloned animals , which i do not support personally , and the labelling of products from  |||  animals  |||  fed on genetically - modified foodstuffs .
( de ) mr president , i would like the end of this  |||  amendment  |||  to be reworded .
there is still enough room for future  |||  amendments  |||  and improvements .
me , when i捌i shrimp was  |||  always  |||  smiling .
|||  although  |||  the political priorities for 2009 have been set , it has not been possible to keep any of the priorities at such a level as to make it clear that they have been favoured financially .
the american  |||  administration  |||  made it clear that military intervention by turkey in northern iraq would not be tolerated .
the commission 's original proposal and the position  |||  adopted  |||  by the committee on the environment on emissions trading both lacked equilibrium , as they put european production in a position that made it hard to compete in global markets without any special climatic benefit .
the european union should act to ensure that  |||  access  |||  is comparable , especially in rural areas .
to this end it is also essential that baroness ashton - our high representative for foreign affairs - and the new european external  |||  action  |||  service work for these same equal rights ; for example , in order that the toolkit to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( lgbt ) people is also used in all non - european countries .
individual terrorists are difficult to identify and here we are discussing privacy laws and whether or not to  |||  adopt  |||  technologically more advanced measures .
as i mentioned previously , this report had come a long way before it was  |||  adopted  |||  unanimously by the committee on legal affairs on 17 december .
we have  |||  achieved  |||  a great deal together , i think .
and today , the commission  |||  adopted  |||  a communication on an eu framework for national roma integration strategies .
then , it will be up to local authorities to decide what is more suitable for them ,  |||  according  |||  to their own objectives and needs .
in a large number of areas where your report , mrs gacek , calls on the commission to act , the commission is already taking  |||  action  |||  to ensure that these rights are reinforced and extended .
at the request of the bureau , i will be in contact with the national ministries for foreign affairs of the countries of the members concerned to establish what  |||  action  |||  the judicial authorities in these countries intend to take .
i cannot let it be said , as i heard just now -  |||  although  |||  everyone was positive - that these would be pious hopes , good intentions , because i should , all the same , like to draw attention to what has already been accomplished .
( hu ) mr president , commissioner , i must say that this directive gives rise to serious concerns  |||  among  |||  the oil processing companies of central and eastern europe .
the  |||  agenda  |||  will be followed by three documents on broadband : firstly , broadband communication , which details the implementation of the agenda with respect to broadband ; secondly , the recommendation on new generation access ( nga ) , which aims to clarify the basis to encourage investment in high - speed internet ; and thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will form the basis of the commission 's strategy to generate enough spectrum for wireless broadband .
these applications , which are largely based on the us gps system at present ,  |||  account  |||  for around 6 % of the eu 's total gdp .
i voted with conviction to  |||  adopt  |||  the legislative resolution , because it makes provision for the simplification of administrative formalities applicable to ships entering or exiting the ports of member states .
in  |||  addition  |||  to this , we need a land policy that provides guaranteed standards on land use that respect its balance , as well as safe building standards .
the  |||  added  |||  value is innovation , because that is what is lacking in comparison with the united states , japan and china .
i therefore want to stress the measures  |||  aimed  |||  at stimulating the birth rate , accompanied by appropriate policies on education and training and on solidarity between the generations , intended to halt the demographic decline of europe .
yet what appealed to the outside world was not  |||  always  |||  an asset in the rough and tumble of israeli politics .
therefore , and taking into  |||  account  |||  the importance of the information society , support is being given to the aid aimed at offering suitable universal broadband coverage at affordable prices to our citizens , and we request that attention is paid to the development of roaming prices in the telecommunications field in subsequent reports .
( es ) mr president , commissioner , a proposal that did not prosper two decades ago is once  |||  again  |||  the subject of discussion and debate due to the financial and economic crisis .
the report that we have voted on urges the turkish government to launch a political initiative  |||  aimed  |||  at finding a lasting settlement to the kurdish problem .
when would you like to stay at the novotel newcastle  |||  airport  |||  ?
however , we also need to  |||  address  |||  fundamental problems such as the falling birth rate among europe 's indigenous population by providing better incentives .
the price for  |||  american  |||  - style democracy , he wrote , was artistic mediocrity and public conformity .
i support the report reviewing the small business act as it  |||  aims  |||  to improve access to credit and access to the market for small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes ) .
ladies and gentlemen , the agreement on the supervision of credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  is an important step , and i , too , would like to thank you , mr gauzès , and , of course , those working alongside you , the committee chair , mrs bowles , as well as the shadow rapporteurs , mr klinz , mr giegold , mr pittella and mr fox .
for the first time since the kennedy  |||  administration  |||  , the us is one of the only liberal democracies in the world with a center - left government .
such amnesties would only perpetuate the  |||  activities  |||  of the criminal gangs that are engaged in illegal immigration and human trafficking .
while we should  |||  accept  |||  his challenge , we should also get our priorities right .
i must admit that parliament hoped for a much more ambitious  |||  agency  |||  .
as a decision - maker at an oil and gas company , your job is defined by a complicated mixture of realities : price volatility , the high costs and risks of working in geographically far - flung and challenging environments , difficult  |||  access  |||  to reserves , and the pressure to find more cost effective exploration and production techniques .
i therefore agree with most of the measures proposed : consumer information , restriction on television  |||  advertising  |||  , nutritional and health information on food labelling .
i hope that , under baroness ashton , the external  |||  action  |||  service will develop into a genuine european service that will represent citizens from all of our member states , women as well as men .
this readmission agreement is therefore a necessary complement to the adoption of the visa facilitation  |||  agreement  |||  reached with georgia , which would necessarily have to be accompanied by an improvement in the security conditions necessary to combat cross - border crime and illegal immigration .
i therefore agree that the european parliament should call on the commission and the member states to ensure that the media and  |||  advertising  |||  professionals guarantee respect for human dignity and make every effort to combat discrimination and any incitement to hatred based on sex , race , ethnic origin , age , religious or other beliefs , sexual orientation , disability and social status .
similarly , i cannot  |||  accept  |||  amendment 10 regarding traps , since the proposal does not include measures to address this issue .
the detroit incident has shown that there is present danger , that the threat persists and , therefore , the member states must not  |||  allow  |||  that continuing flow of financial data to the tftp to be abandoned .
furthermore , in this context , we will specifically carry out the macro - economic and micro - economic analysis which forms part of this basel  |||  agreement  |||  , and you and your colleagues will naturally be informed about it , mr karas .
they can continue with their money ,  |||  although  |||  they are not producing cotton in the future .
( pt ) the barcelona process exists only because a series of central european policy issues are  |||  affected  |||  by our relationship with the south .
this virtual monopoly on information and its financing allows him to dominate , control and direct not only the majority of the audiovisual press and publishing media , but also their content , to his sole  |||  advantage  |||  .
the aim of this policy is to do away with physical , administrative and regulatory obstacles to cohesion , and to reduce the ' border effect ' between territories and regions in order to enable them to  |||  address  |||  their shared challenges together , whether those challenges are territorial ( services , infrastructure , urban and regional planning ) , global ( globalisation , climate change ) , economic or societal .
in relation to the  |||  above  |||  , i think the sanchez - schmid report on a challenge for territorial cooperation - the future agenda for cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation is an important contribution to work on regional policy , and i voted in favour of its adoption .
the most important element of the compromise reached relates to the effective separation - and i stress the word ' effective ' - of production and supply  |||  activities  |||  , on the one hand , from network operations , on the other .
for the time being , i regret to say that  |||  although  |||  the eu has shown leadership in a number of areas , where financing is concerned we are still not in a position to put the figures that will be required on the table .
i have pleasure in informing you that this year we again sponsored a resolution on intolerance based on religion or belief which was  |||  adopted  |||  by consensus in the un third committee .
according to the media ,  |||  afghan  |||  soldiers are lucky if they earn usd 20 .
the report does not state the fundamental fact that , in the eight years before israel , in its own defence , took  |||  action  |||  in the gaza strip , thousands of rockets were fired at innocent israeli citizens .
once again , parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the european globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations .
to accomplish this , a follow - up conference to the bonn  |||  agreement  |||  is also required .
first , all political parties agree that welfare - state arrangements should remain tax - financed ,  |||  although  |||  possibly with a stronger application of insurance principles in the social insurance systems .
in  |||  addition  |||  , it is not clear what it takes for a substance to be declared so hazardous that it has to be banned completely .
i think that the reference to ' hidden ' advertising mechanisms that have developed on the internet and are now in use there is appropriate ; in many cases the  |||  advertising  |||  is disguised as opinions or comments on social networking sites , forums or blogs .
it is noted that by adopting a decision to waive the member 's immunity , the european parliament is  |||  allowing  |||  the competent national authority to hold the person accountable ( given that there is no interference with the functioning and independence of the institution ) and by no means does this decision confirm the member 's guilt or express an opinion as to whether certain actions or views justify investigation .
once  |||  again  |||  we can see that the foundations of russian democracy are very weak .
agriculture is , and will continue to be , directly affected by climate change , because it involves living organisms and its outcomes are influenced ,  |||  above  |||  all , by the quality of the soil , water and air .
but to measure weight , is  |||  among  |||  the most lightweight and thin .
for the  |||  above  |||  reasons , i voted in favour of this resolution approving the conclusion of the agreement .

the next item is the report by luciana sbarbati , on behalf of the committee on petitions , on the  |||  annual  |||  report on the european ombudsman 's activities in 2006 .
let us not forget that the fund was created to provide  |||  additional  |||  support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in the global business sector , and after 1 may 2009 , also to those made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis .
( fr ) madam president , the eradication of poverty is  |||  actually  |||  a millennium development goal , but it is also a european objective in europe .
i believe that it would therefore be better to finally  |||  acknowledge  |||  the need to follow the path outlined but not followed , rather than to try to make a final effort to achieve in two years what we did not manage to achieve in eight .
in addition to the lack of an adequate civilian and security presence to reassure every community of its safety , the overall lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created  |||  additional  |||  tension .
if we content ourselves with words  |||  alone  |||  , however , the aggressor may strike again .
i have been advised that the precedent is as follows : where there is an oral  |||  amendment  |||  to an oral amendment , if the first person who tabled the oral amendment accepts the second oral amendment as a consensus , it is taken into account .
the proposal , which is a consolidated text  |||  agreed  |||  upon with the council and the commission , broadens the definition of trafficking , bearing in mind that the forms and trends are changing .
as i said , the commission is monitoring the situation  |||  according  |||  to the rules of eu competition law , and if there is a need for steps to be taken , they will be taken independently when the moment is right , when we conclude that action needs to be taken .
frankly , the first version was promising , in terms both of its  |||  analysis  |||  of the causes of the crisis and of many of the proposals for overcoming it .
we are trying to take practical , pragmatic  |||  action  |||  to assist part of the afghan population .
the regulation  |||  adopted  |||  in 2009 simplifies the provisions of the single payment system , thereby improving the effectiveness of the 2003 cap reform .
the eu will need a great deal more integration , perhaps until it becomes a centralised mega - state , before it is likely to operate a grand foreign policy and military strategy in the conventional  |||  american  |||  sense .
( de ) madam president , development aid is  |||  always  |||  costly , often unfortunately ineffective and sometimes even harmful , because it all too frequently does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question .
however , it is not  |||  always  |||  evident when people and parties stand for election what they are going to do if they win .
cultural  |||  activities  |||  are a vital source of enrichment for children by promoting intercultural dialogue .

|||  american  |||  arguments against russian cooperation center on iran 's motives for developing nuclear power .
there is no reason for it : there is an  |||  adequate  |||  parliament building in brussels .
i am very pleased to see that , with the rare exceptions who have  |||  admitted  |||  their obvious ignorance of the situation in the balkan countries , the vast majority of this house agrees that it is time we supported the tearing down of visa walls in the western balkans .
on the other hand , the integrated approach means also the need for integrating different sectoral policies both at the eu and member state level , which  |||  affect  |||  the development of all our territories .
|||  although  |||  health policy remains ( for the most part ) a national responsibility , we meps have a duty to encourage our member states to continue their efforts to reduce socio - economic inequalities , thereby also reducing disparities in healthcare .
' whereas the european parliament shall not  |||  accept  |||  double standards ; whereas , in order to put political pressure on journalists disclosing corruption cases linked to high - ranking officials and ruling party politicians , the government administration in hungary has recently introduced steps to launch criminal proceedings against such members of the media ; ' - namely mr tamás pindroch , the journalist from the magyar hírlap - ' whereas bearing in mind in particular that criminal proceedings were launched against the journalist who was investigating the scandals of a high - ranking former member of the government and one of the candidates for european commissioner ; whereas this has resulted in an atmosphere where the press is under political pressure in hungary ' .
the $ 82 billion " emergency supplemental " bill to finance american military operations in iraq and  |||  afghanistan  |||  leaves the united states spending more money on military power than is needed on a yearly basis to permit every child in the world to receive , within one decade , both primaryandsecondary education .
i should like to refer to  |||  another  |||  specific point , namely transport , for it is important that we should succeed in securing the inclusion of transport in the post - kyoto agreement .
the exchange rate is a safety valve : when an economy becomes uncompetitive -- say , if international demand for its products declines , or domestic costs rise  |||  above  |||  other countries -- a decline in the currency 's value can restore demand for the nation 's output , and so help preserve employment .
this technical  |||  amendment  |||  will simplify the management of revenue - generating projects where possible , by limiting the administrative burden in accordance with the principle of proportionality .

while acknowledging that the final text adopted today in strasbourg is less negative than the text that was previously  |||  agreed  |||  in parliamentary committee , the imposition of this charge will still become a reality and will mean an increase in existing costs for the outlying countries of the eu .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although we are dealing with it at a late hour , i believe that what we have here is an important argument that should be highly valued , because the therapeutic use of stem cells from the umbilical cord should be upheld , just as initiatives and information campaigns  |||  aimed  |||  at making the possibility of donating stem cells more widespread should be encouraged and promoted at every level , all the more so at the european level .
it must be hard and require enormous effort to acquire the unique skills that mark the superstar and earn societies ' respect and  |||  admiration  |||  .
the fundamental shape of the common agricultural policy for the years 2007-2013 that was  |||  adopted  |||  by the ministers of agriculture of the eu countries on 26 june 2003 in luxembourg includes some solutions that benefit poland .

what is needed in this area , therefore , is support for  |||  alternative  |||  sources of income , especially the development of tourism and the associated infrastructure .
i also hope -  |||  although  |||  mr rehn has already begun to make proposals - that the second lesson that we learn from all this is that we need to introduce a number of structural reforms , namely a preventive chapter in the stability and growth pact - which mr rehn has proposed - a european monetary fund , a structural mechanism that can be used straight away and , thirdly , a 2020 strategy that is far more robust than the strategy that is down on paper today .
i also voted in favour of  |||  amendment  |||  12 which , in order to ensure adequate funding for rural development programmes , maintains that greater flexibility should be introduced to enable the use , within the same member state , of unspent resources from the structural funds for this purpose .
it is probably time that we chopped our way out of the undergrowth in the establishment of this european external  |||  action  |||  service and that the eu was heard again in the outside world .
i support the commission 's proposal and the own - initiative report , but i would point out , once  |||  again  |||  , that , on this issue , rapid and uniform implementation is crucial .

the report that we have  |||  adopted  |||  seems to me to be moving , albeit slowly , in this direction .
moreover , whereas members of all ethnic groups committed crimes , in its first years , the icty indicted and prosecuted far more serbs than others , fueling a perception , even  |||  among  |||  opponents of milosevic 's regime , that the tribunal was political and anti - serbian .
what i would like the commission to give an  |||  answer  |||  to or concede here is whether it will face up to the fact that were greece not bound by the position set out by frankfurt , then greece would have devalued , and this devaluation would have remedied a large part of the problems that greece is facing .
export - oriented companies in the software and other industries enjoy tax holidays on their profits ,  |||  although  |||  their employees do pay taxes on their personal incomes .
therefore , in this case , why did we only take into  |||  account  |||  the use of an old virtual mathematical and meteorological model and ignore the pilot unions , which recommended test flights and the use of weather balloons ?
zoo chleby lies on area of only 0.8 hectare ( 1.98 acre ) . so it does not have an  |||  aims  |||  to have hundreds animal species or some big animals .
the european union must show itself to be more effective in this regard and cannot allow the privilege of monopoly  |||  access  |||  to raw materials or a majority shareholding to decide the situation in the market .
furthermore , new surveys to cover deep - sea fishing grounds will be included as part of the member states ' obligations , and  |||  additional  |||  biological sampling will be requested in our implementation proposal for data collection .

generally they do not contact the council as an institution , but target their  |||  activity  |||  at the member states .
laying down an overall , permanent target for the reduction of pesticide use at eu level , however , in  |||  addition  |||  to national targets , is not necessary and is therefore not endorsed by the commission .
i believe that the proposed directive will improve  |||  access  |||  to organs for european citizens requiring a transplant , increase trust in the donor system and encourage the exchange of good practices which can be applied at supranational level .
it has also  |||  accepted  |||  the restrictions that the council imposed quite strictly , particularly with regard to payment appropriations .
i therefore challenge the european commission to prepare a european response to the crisis for the outermost regions , which goes beyond the measures already  |||  announced  |||  under the economic and social cohesion policy for the european regions in general .
the  |||  amendments  |||  were rejected .
mr president , with regard to the anti - counterfeiting trade  |||  agreement  |||  ( acta ) , the current negotiations completely lack transparency .
secondly , we must have a common system of accounting - used by all member states , based on a standardised and internationally  |||  accepted  |||  method of accounting , and agreed between the member states , commission and parliament .
fishing is very important to the whole of the eu , therefore it should not simply be seen as an  |||  activity  |||  , but as a sector which is a direct source of employment .
in relation to climate change i really support the contention about flexibility in the sphere of emissions policy , since , for example , my country  |||  achieved  |||  and exceeded the 20 % target for the use of renewable energy sources some time ago .
this is yet  |||  another  |||  document that has signed up to the tendency to create institutions that have no sense to them and which take money from the community 's budget .
what is important is to take  |||  action  |||  , and i echo what mr deprez said .
at a time when the food crisis is affecting the most fragile developing countries and  |||  access  |||  to water and education remains restricted , it is understandable that the eu must redouble its efforts to achieve the mdg objective of allocating 0.7 % of its gnp to development aid by the year 2015 .
at the same time they  |||  allow  |||  it to be controlled , ensuring that users have greater security and feel better about their lives .

i am pleased that mr parish plans to introduce an oral  |||  amendment  |||  tomorrow to ensure that the rules on the authorisation period for projects are made clearer .
for this reason , i have  |||  agreed  |||  with the rapporteur and have voted in favour of these reports .
in writing . - i decided to abstain at the final vote because we lost amendment 1 on reference to nato ,  |||  amendment  |||  3 against a nuclear dimension in the common security and defence policy , amendment 4 against flexible use of battlegroups , amendment 5 against using battlegroups for mixed civilian - military tasks , amendment 6 deleting a provision on defence research , amendment 7 deleting a provision on defence research , amendment 8 deleting reference to the us department of homeland security , amendment 9 deleting reference to csdp cooperation with frontex in the mediterranean , and despite the fact that we won amendment 2 on european external action service / commission permanent working structures and amendment 1 saying no to nato developing civilian capabilities .
thirdly , in the overall approach towards central asia ,  |||  account  |||  must be taken of the major political and economic differences between the countries of the region .
we do , of course , have to take  |||  account  |||  of this because a great deal of maize is currently being produced for biofuels in the united states .
i have a good report that citizens in slovakia , in the week from 25 to 27 october , not only took an interest in the fact that we  |||  adopted  |||  the report of my colleague , renate sommer , at the first reading , but also created such a powerful synergetic effect that students of nitra university , the agri - food industry and the media and the wider public got hugely involved in these debates , organising workshops and competitions , while young people got involved in a discussion which was , i must say , given a further boost through the participation of rapporteur renate sommer herself , while the three slovak meps also took an active part in the process .
this is a first step and i would like to think that many of our proposals will be  |||  adopted  |||  by the commission as well .
i do not believe , however , that imposing restrictions on the food producers  |||  alone  |||  will result in a reduction in the number of overweight individuals .

' 23 million small and medium - sized enterprises in europe will also look to brussels and await the reply from the heads of state or government .

in this interim economic partnership agreement with the republic of the fiji islands and papua new guinea , the eu has also been subjected to severe criticism by social and political organisations in the pacific region due to the pressures that have been put on these two countries to sign the  |||  agreement  |||  , under the threat of losing their privileged access to european markets .
mr president , just to understand , what you are telling us is that , for the vote on a vice - president , it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority , because , if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention , and if abstentions do not count towards the total vote , then by definition , you  |||  always  |||  get a qualified majority .
a lot of this has been  |||  achieved  |||  in cooperation with the european parliament , with the climate and energy package forming the basis for the eu 's ambitious positions .

it is open to question whether european contract law will improve market  |||  access  |||  for small enterprises because , according to analyses , it is mainly medium to large - sized retail businesses that are involved in cross - border trade , something that is due to the bureaucratic red tape entailed , as well as the costs .
i voted in favour of this provision , but it was not  |||  adopted  |||  , and i regret that .
madam president , i , too , would like to take this opportunity to  |||  acknowledge  |||  the fine work done by mr rangel with regard to a number of the sections in the report .
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - ( de ) madam president , since the establishment of the european border security  |||  agency  |||  , frontex , the implementation of the european work programmes has been proceeding effectively and according to plan .
so who will now counsel obama that piling on  |||  additional  |||  deficits and debt to fund a vast expansion of spending is bad economics , that the costs are likely to far outweigh the benefits , and that raising taxes will do permanent long - term damage to the economy ?

one indication of this is the shooting down of an unmanned drone by a russian  |||  aircraft  |||  , as there is no doubt whatsoever that this was not done by an abkhazian air force plane .

that is for the british people and our elected representatives in our house of parliament in westminster to decide , just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put messrs blair , brown and cameron on trial for war crimes , because  |||  afghanistan  |||  , just like iraq , is a criminal war .

if we are not given  |||  access  |||  to the documents , none of the eu institutions will be fulfilling its role or meeting our citizens ' expectations .

( fr ) madam president , as already stated , the european union has been negotiating the conclusion of a free trade  |||  agreement  |||  with the gulf cooperation council for nearly 20 years .
that said , i am against this report , as it contains elements that are absolutely unacceptable , such as the broadening of the term refugee way beyond what the geneva convention currently states ; rejecting the regulation of safe third countries that we had already managed to reach a positive  |||  agreement  |||  on ; giving frontex tasks that have absolutely nothing to do with it ; allowing asylum seekers a free choice of which country is to be responsible for the procedure - which represents the abandonment of the dublin convention ; and easier access to the labour market for asylum seekers .

firstly , transparency of action , full transparency of procedures , of the evaluation criteria  |||  adopted  |||  and their results , and then communications and a communications strategy , because the actions taken on anti - dumping by the european commission can serve to reassure our business people and workers .

however , failure to reach this  |||  agreement  |||  now looks like it lies more with the member states than with our negotiating partner .
these programmes have  |||  achieved  |||  great success in the union .
i voted for this report because i essentially share the rapporteur 's concerns , particularly as regards  |||  amendments  |||  pertaining to the following key issues : 1 ) the eu 's framework for budgetary surveillance should be broadened so as to include employment and social aspects ; 2 ) the guidelines for member states ' employment policies should be taken into account when they present their respective stability and convergence programmes , as well as during the examination of those programmes ; 3 ) the multilateral surveillance of the stability and convergence programmes should be conducted as part of the european semester ; and 4 ) the stability and convergence programmes of the member states should include information on the consistency of the member states ' budgetary objectives with the eu 's growth and jobs strategy , such as the europe 2020 strategy , and in particular with the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for the employment policies .

i  |||  agree  |||  with the proposal that the eu must speak with one voice in relation to issues being dealt with .

important issues are : eu contacts with iran ( paragraph 32 ) where , as regards the background of the controversy over whether the ep 's iran delegation should be  |||  allowed  |||  to travel to iran , the text now calls - contrary to the wishes of the rapporteur - for contacts with a broad range of actors , without making a direct reference to the delegation ; sanctions ( paragraph 42 ) , where the text calls for targeted sanctions on the main human rights offenders - so far , there are only sanctions on persons linked to the nuclear dossier ; and the opening of an eu embassy in tehran - in parallel with almost all member states that have a representation in the country .

in short , then , all the  |||  amendments  |||  are acceptable from our point of view , which means that we can now finally bring this important and generally non - contentious matter to a conclusion .
moreover , i do not  |||  agree  |||  with the assertion made in the resolution that the responsibility for respect for international law and fundamental rights rests with all democratic countries , particularly the european union .
using the european globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund is a short - and medium - term solution for supporting workers who are in a tough situation after losing their jobs .

in ethiopia , for example , which is the headquarters of the  |||  african  |||  union , the people are oppressed under the cover of rhetoric that sounds good to donors , but which is no less crude and shameless .
|||  another  |||  issue that we face , both in the short term and in the long term , is , of course , the climate and the financing of climate policy .
lastly , the third course of  |||  action  |||  : wherever we intervene , by civilian , police or military means , i believe we must undertake to give women a significant and appropriate role within our own troops and operational delegations .

is the european union itself a champion in all these fields , taking into  |||  account  |||  , for example , the situation of the media in italy and hungary , mass statelessness in latvia and estonia and the suspicion of corruption in our parliament ?
i have an oral  |||  amendment  |||  , therefore we will keep all of the amendments and propose that we simply delete the name and surname of the president of the italian republic .
russia 's fall back to earth , meanwhile , spawned a kind of parlor game among academics , foreign - policy wonks , and educated investors ,  |||  aimed  |||  at replacing the country in the club of major emerging - market economies .

it is important that the european investment bank has  |||  always  |||  considered this to be a vital objective , and today 's debate also reassures us all that it will continue to work in partnership with the european parliament , commission and council in striving towards these goals .
i call on the commission now to take real  |||  action  |||  , to assess whether the italy - libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the italian government 's nefarious policy .
i would just like to point out that effectively , the jpa is a matter for mps , but that the commission plays an important role , of course , in development policies at european level , and on that basis it is my wish that the commission should not consider - and i think that commissioner michel , in any case , is included here - the work of this assembly as anecdotal work , that it should not consider this assembly as a sort of safety valve where the tensions between us are discussed , but rather that it takes into  |||  account  |||  the opinions expressed there , since for many of our acp colleagues , this is unfortunately the only forum where they are able to express themselves .
amendments have also been tabled and we will continue voting on the  |||  amendments  |||  one by one .
the us had not revised its policy , even with an  |||  african  |||  immigrant 's son living in the white house .
a better arms control system would undoubtedly make it more difficult for non - nuclear weapons states to acquire nuclear capability ; but it is hard to see why reductions  |||  alone  |||  , however dramatic , in the huge number of american and russian warheads should induce aspiring nuclear powers to give up their nuclear ambitions . even if america and russia agreed to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear warheads from 5,000-6,000 each to 1,000 each , why should that stop iran from wanting to build 50-100 nuclear warheads and short - range delivery systems if it perceives this to be in its national interest ?

his visit to ankara was inflammatory , and it is a pity that german christian democrats do not take max fischer 's  |||  advice  |||  and look in the mirror , because the akp today is the mirror image of the german cdu in 1950 - not christian democrat , but islamic democrat - and that is no doubt why the commissioner says that he understands and shares turkey 's frustrations .
the european parliament has always supported the frontex  |||  agency  |||  since its creation , especially in terms of providing financial resources .
the  |||  amended  |||  version now before the house bears such little resemblance to the original one , which was defeated in committee , so i think that , if we duly follow our own procedures , we have no option but to refer it either back to committee or to the legal services for arbitration .
all technical discussions and question and  |||  answer  |||  about php and asp script takes place in this section .

for their part ,  |||  african  |||  players grumbled that their absence from europe reduced their commercial opportunities during a crucial period of league play .

( de ) mr president , what was negotiated for the swift  |||  agreement  |||  and is now to be sold as data protection is , in fact , an embarrassing act of self - deception on the part of europeans .

it is up to the chastened nations of western europe , which broadly share american values but have learned something about political patience , to rein in the  |||  american  |||  fantasy of re - making the world in its own image .
the same can be said with regard to finding answers to problems  |||  affecting  |||  both europe and africa , in particular the effects of climate change , management of energy resources and migration flows .
we appreciate the progress that has been  |||  achieved  |||  recently .

in writing . - i support this allocation of € 14.8 million of european globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund ( egaf ) support to the 2 840 workers of dell in limerick who have lost their jobs following the closure of their plant because , rather than dell , it will benefit the redundant workers directly .

( de ) madam president , mr wathelet , commissioner , i believe that we are all agreed , even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the eurosceptic to anti - europe fractions of this house , that the eu performs important tasks and that the performance of these tasks represents european  |||  added  |||  value , because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states .
this would also  |||  allow  |||  the prerogatives of the new legislative framework ( nlf ) on products , which was approved in 2008 , to be respected .

i have one question for commissioner dimas : following our first - reading  |||  agreement  |||  on my report on the revised eu - ets six weeks ago , could the commissioner put on record today exactly what work programme is in train for preparing the comitology decisions , particularly the timing and involvement of this parliament and the stakeholders ?

repeating the savings ampamp ; loan debacle of the 1980 's . the banks are using bad accounting ( they were  |||  allowed  |||  , for example , to keep impaired assets on their books without writing them down , on the fiction that they might be held to maturity and somehow turn healthy ) .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate mrs gurmai on the raft of ideas she has put forward ; i have to say that there is so much human and artificial intelligence in this report and i hope that the former will  |||  always  |||  take precedence over the latter as otherwise we are opening up a different can of worms , and while one of our objectives must therefore be to propose safer , cleaner and more intelligent vehicles , our objective must also be , as proposed , to halve the number of deaths on our roads by 2010 .
we should also encourage china to provide unconditional assistance to african partners and the economic conditions associated with international subsidies or loans should not  |||  affect  |||  the objective of sustainable development .
the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egaf ) is an important instrument used by the european commission to alleviate the economic crisis and provide assistance to the people directly  |||  affected  |||  .

the second initiative that i  |||  announced  |||  at the end of september was the review and updating of the fourth and seventh accounting directives .

the proposed  |||  amendment  |||  , which is calling for resources to be allocated to educate consumers on financial matters , has been rejected by a majority in the budget committee .

it is something that this is still very much on our  |||  agenda  |||  in the eu , and it must also stay there .
it is a process of many issues around  |||  access  |||  to finance .
it is only being made politically weaker by policy makers who are implementing policies  |||  aimed  |||  at damping down national debate in the short term .
this is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the us will need in the years  |||  ahead  |||  .
while both sides have cause for complaint , i am  |||  afraid  |||  that what we find in this question is naked anti - americanism and a petty , little european mentality .
this is only the beginning of a new process where we can  |||  actually  |||  cut emissions and energy consumption in buildings significantly .

today , as my  |||  american  |||  colleague says , i think the only thing we are seeing is not the disappearance of capital , but the disappearance of the consequences of subprimes .
the question is whether , on the one hand , we are brave enough to be the first to take  |||  action  |||  and make the necessary sacrifices , and on the other hand , how we will share the burden among the various social and economic actors .
the single currency 's  |||  advocates  |||  are right about one thing : political motives have always underpinned the establishment of monetary unions , from latin america 's in the period from 1865 to 1927 to that between ireland and britain from 1922 to 1979 .
|||  allow  |||  me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report .
a common european market means ,  |||  above  |||  all , that we give the national regulators more opportunity , more power , and that we establish common european criteria , so that no one regulator makes completely different decisions to the others and we do not have a situation where one is dependent on the government and the others are not and we have a european agency , which , in cooperation with the commission , can really work towards forming a european market .
but that requires commitment to a real vision of what constitutes a minimally functioning  |||  afghan  |||  state , beyond the obvious need for effective security forces .
( fi ) madam president , commissioner , i think the report on the amendment to the prospectus directive is a positive one because many of these  |||  amendments  |||  reduce the administrative burden of companies , so the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have together done an excellent job .
if the report is to conform to the strategy , it is essential that elements of the strategy that we have already  |||  agreed  |||  upon and approved be reflected in this proposal for a regulation .
so i suppose my question is , what steps , if any , has the commission taken to  |||  address  |||  any of those issues ?
this is a consultation which does not confine itself to the agreement itself but includes its preamble and annex , which we appreciate , because ,  |||  although  |||  they are technical , they contain provisions which are of great political significance .
all older children or  |||  adults  |||  are charged cad 25.00 per night for extra beds .
parliament has  |||  adopted  |||  a good text .
this kind of moralising and selective memory  |||  among  |||  the european socialists shows that historical materialism has been superseded by hysterical relativism .
|||  amendment  |||  41 on the promotion of a european wage policy proposed a minimum wage of at least 50 % of the national average wage , and this seemed to me to be essential for combating the low pay that often leads to poverty .

in march , parliament  |||  adopted  |||  the guidelines for 2011 .
as you added today ,  |||  america  |||  needs europe .
i agree with the principles  |||  according  |||  to which it is necessary to prevent irresponsible arms transfers by the strict application of the code 's criteria to both companies and national armed forces , and to prevent illegal arms trafficking by calling on all member states that have not yet done so to transpose into their national legislation the 2003 eu common position on the control of arms brokering .
this specific package , the case of delegated  |||  acts  |||  , is what could be the first significant example that the role of the european parliament has indeed grown since 1 december 2009 .
i also wish to express my thanks  |||  above  |||  all to my colleagues who , here today as on so many days in the past , have shown the extent to which they are aware of the importance of this sector to european economic growth and , therefore , to the employment and welfare of all european citizens .
therefore the amendments cannot be  |||  accepted  |||  .
i also think that it is extremely important not to  |||  allow  |||  resources collected from road tolls to be transferred to other means of transport .
add to that the demographic crisis that is  |||  affecting  |||  some countries , and we have a recipe for guaranteed economic decline .
within the current recession , we have already had a double dip ; a dip at the beginning of 2008 , then some growth , then  |||  another  |||  long , deep dip , then renewed growth .

anyone who does not love  |||  animals  |||  does not love people either .
on  |||  action  |||  against discrimination , the presidency has promised to move the new directive forward .
a well - conceived european public company statute , intended to supplement the legal forms which already exist , would benefit the competitiveness of european smes in many respects : it would consolidate the european internal market , simplify the legal framework for enterprises , thereby reducing consultancy costs and facilitating  |||  access  |||  to cross - border markets , and it would improve economic integration and growth .
specific emission targets for  |||  alternative  |||  fuel vehicles will be incorporated , aimed at promoting further deployment of certain alternative fuel vehicles in the union market ;
mr ivanilovas must be  |||  allowed  |||  to return to lithuania .
among other small detail that is always when you notice strange characters in emails ( like this и ) instead of accented letters , pricked his ears at once , because it  |||  almost  |||  always means that the text written by someone who uses a different encoding type the cyrillic .
concrete  |||  actions  |||  would have to follow ; for example , the consistent inclusion of clauses prohibiting the persecution of christians in international trade agreements with the eu .

( pl ) madam president , the majority of us can take free  |||  access  |||  to water for granted .
governments have traditionally been very hierarchical , but the information revolution is  |||  affecting  |||  the structure of organizations .
it remains to be seen whether , in the future , this parliament will live up to what it has approved here today , or whether , as is often the case , it makes these good points , but later , when it needs to  |||  actually  |||  put them into practice , goes back on its word and approves legislation that violates these principles .
what  |||  additional  |||  and more effective action can be taken there ?
|||  again  |||  , for all those who are complaining about this point of compromise , there is a great possibility : go to your countries and ask the governments of austria , sweden , denmark , finland and the other countries - there are 12 of them listed - which have asked for this one additional per cent , and tell them not to use the cdms that are permitted under this compromise .
how this is  |||  achieved  |||  is not a matter for the eu .
sanctions on syria were imposed yesterday - an embargo on arms , an asset freeze and a travel ban for 13 key individuals in the regime , the freezing of our association  |||  agreement  |||  and of our cooperation with syria . let us be blunt and clear , as i was with the foreign minister of syria yesterday .

|||  above  |||  all , i think the timing and complexity of solutions is important , because you have evoked a wide range of solutions here , but it is quite clear that solutions that may involve some new european - level judicial mechanisms will clearly take far longer and potentially be more controversial than picking up some of the alternative dispute resolution measures or also using the existing consumer cooperation measures that have been put in place .
in conclusion , let me also thank the rapporteur for his positive collaboration , reflected in some compromise  |||  amendments  |||  which put the report 's main emphasis on trade and trade related issues , alongside topics of human rights and sustainable development .
i am in favour of adopting a compromise between a single eu approach and rules  |||  according  |||  to which the member states could also engage in bilateral negotiations with the us .
according to local civil organisations and the world federation of the deaf ( www.wfdeaf.org ) , the government of queensland and the australian communications and media authority ( acma ) should be proud - in spite of the tragedies which , regrettably , still occurred - of the success  |||  achieved  |||  by their excellent preparation and cooperation , and particularly of providing live and immediate communication that reached the deaf .
the union ought to maximise its efforts in facilitating the access to available resources - within the ceilings of the  |||  agreed  |||  multiannual financial framework 2007-2013 - for beneficiaries on the ground and we should therefore particularly improve and simplify measures in order to accelerate the implementation of structural and cohesion funds .
the research of madrian and her colleagues suggests that the new pension plans will improve saving in the countries that  |||  adopt  |||  them .
i feel the formula suggested by the rapporteur is the proper solution , but he has also addressed another issue : there is , of course ,  |||  another  |||  aspect , which is the economic side of the matter .
but the prolonged period of low interest rates that followed the 2001 recession instead contributed to the emergence of  |||  another  |||  bubble , this time in real estate and credit .
mr president , as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled , in the last three years , we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting european union interests and citizens in the southern sahara , which has become a haven for the islamic branch of  |||  al-qaeda  |||  , with a whole string of murders , kidnappings , extortion , blackmail , drug trafficking and people trafficking , the victims of which have been german , italian , spanish and , most recently , french citizens .

wess mitchell is director of research at the center for european policy  |||  analysis  |||  ( cepa ) , washington , dc .
i have therefore supported  |||  amendments  |||  to exempt airports in the outermost regions from the new regime , and look forward to the production of a framework that takes account of the fragile nature of many communities .
will this be on the council  |||  agenda  |||  ?
the commission proposal has been  |||  amended  |||  in a way that the committee on industry , research and energy is also proposing .
also i am finding that member states are not even willing to explore co - location with  |||  another  |||  member state or a common application centre .
good ideas  |||  always  |||  spread , so that should not be too difficult .
in this context , i have already recommended to the council to modify the proposed date of entry into force of the directive , in order to  |||  allow  |||  its application as quickly as possible after a positive decision is taken by the council .
but yet  |||  again  |||  the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue , with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low - cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension .
as i was able to give the floor to five speakers , and as only three  |||  actually  |||  spoke , i decided to also give the floor to mr evans .
as a user of this service , you will uphold this code of conduct and  |||  agree  |||  to be liable for all submissions , content or feedback ( as such terms are defined in the terms of use ) that you post or upload ( ' member submissions ' ) .

we can therefore only express our satisfaction at the commission 's decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool ,  |||  although  |||  in my opinion , in a too simplistic and superficial way , undoubtedly due to a fear of unleashing the fury of the council regarding these matters .
indeed , its record is  |||  almost  |||  unique in turkey 's modern history , comparable only with the rule of the democratic party ( dp ) , which came to power in the 1950 's , at the start of multi - party parliamentary democracy in turkey , and ran the country for a decade .

ladies and gentlemen ,  |||  allow  |||  me to congratulate slovakia on taking this big step and achieving this huge success . i also want to emphasise that this is clearly the result of the work of successive slovak governments and the understanding and will of the slovak people .
the european parliament 's unshakeable determination and longstanding efforts to defend human rights and democracy  |||  across  |||  the globe by applying a firm and effective policy in defending human rights in the eu should be recalled here .
the fact is , that this country is vital for european and global security , and it is for this reason , as pino arlacchi 's report details very well , that we need to correct the huge errors committed in the move to investing in ' afghanisation ' and putting the human safety of the  |||  afghan  |||  people first , which involves a responsibility to protect on the part of the foreign forces present .

i supported it because individual member states cannot cope with this situation  |||  alone  |||  : cooperation and sharing must guide the way we handle it .
by pumping in whatever liquidity the financial sector needs to alleviate the credit crunch , the ecb is effectively maintaining a deflationary bias for the financial sector , whereas it has  |||  announced  |||  an inflationary bias for the rest of the economy .
i am bound to point out that parliament and council have failed to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  over this matter .
however , the  |||  actual  |||  result is 3-1 in favour of the treaty 's opponents .
these euro securities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability through markets as well as , by taking  |||  advantage  |||  of the increase in liquidity , ensuring that the member states enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates .
obviously , parliament 's opinion is very important to us , not least in these final moments before the stockholm programme is  |||  adopted  |||  by the european council .
the rapporteur 's oral  |||  amendment  |||  reflected these positive trends in russia .
as regards the debates in the council up to now , i should say that the ministers have unanimously supported the need for the reform , involving simplifying the rules , enhancing the role of the regions and decentralising decision making , except on strategic elements and principles , and they  |||  agree  |||  that it is essential to reduce discards , overcapacity and overfishing .

my final observation concerns the need for universal  |||  access  |||  to childcare centres .
it is not acceptable , either , that improvement in the quality of health care should be  |||  achieved  |||  by making treatment providers compete , or to argue the principle of the free movement of patients : the latter depends above all on their state of health .
and , to  |||  answer  |||  one of the rapporteur 's suggestions immediately , i could say that , yes , i am ready to come here every six months , as parliament calls me , to monitor the implementation of these agreements .
it is also important to know that , when deciding on the common agricultural policy health check , we will take into  |||  account  |||  the conclusions of the european council on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 and the european council 's appeal to the commission to carry out a comprehensive eu budget and expenditure review for 2008-2009 .
however , i would like to focus on the fisheries  |||  agreement  |||  with the union of the comoros .

i must also remind her that the draft framework decision on data protection  |||  actually  |||  lays down detailed rules that will also apply to information exchanged between the contact points of the european judicial network , but we should certainly make sure of this .
|||  according  |||  to a eurobarometer survey , 70 % of european union citizens do not smoke and the majority would like smoking to be banned in public places .
after lengthy negotiations , we have managed to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  that satisfies parliament .
first of all ,  |||  allow  |||  me , as a greek mep , to tell you that greece will make it .
i hope that i spelled out at the beginning the priorities and plans for the period ahead , together with the recognition of the balance that needs to be struck between channelling resources through the  |||  afghan  |||  government and recognising the importance of ensuring that we battle corruption appropriately , in order to safeguard the resources that we have .
it is hypocritical to promote democracy and then sign a trade  |||  agreement  |||  that denies workers the basic democratic right to organize and join unions .
two weeks ago , i was in belgrade and , in meetings with education and training providers , i was once  |||  again  |||  assured of the importance of the agency .

the sooner we have such an  |||  agreement  |||  in place , the sooner we will see the green investments and green growth we so badly need .
in this context , i hope that the new belgian presidency will want to include this text on its  |||  agenda  |||  , thereby allowing the completion of the framework of regulations for passengers on all modes of transport , with a view to considering the laying down of common and horizontal measures for all modes of transport .
nevertheless , the review of its  |||  action  |||  plan must be more coherent , using objectives that are more measurable and indicators that are more reliable .

another comment concerned the ultima ratio , whether we have actually done everything possible to find a solution that is  |||  acceptable  |||  to all member states .

on the basis of the recommendation made to the european parliament in the report by my excellent colleague and friend , mrs mathieu , i voted in favour of granting the director of the european  |||  agency  |||  for reconstruction discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for 2008 .
as this year 's deficit is projected to be more than 12 % of a shrinking gdp , the debt - to - gdp ratio will soar  |||  above  |||  125 % by the end of 2010 , the highest in the euro zone .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the more states possess nuclear weapons , the greater the prospects that terrorists will gain access to them .
|||  although  |||  both the lisbon strategy and the eu 2020 strategy attach greater emphasis than ever before to social policy , the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority to the detriment of social issues .

america 's political system usually works well in crises . but , thanks to its residual  |||  advantages  |||  in a leaderless world , the us need not rely on a crisis to precipitate action .
as a result , its ability to maintain services -- and the military capacity to respond to any maneuver by the khartoum government  |||  aimed  |||  against the peace agreement -- is seriously compromised .
i would highlight the measures i consider necessary : making use of all the possibilities and financial margins available under the eu fisheries budget in order to finance emergency support measures for this sector , thereby enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in oil prices ; continued european fisheries fund ( eff ) aid to improve the selectivity of fishing gear and to replace engines on safety grounds , to protect the environment and / or fuel economy , above all , for small - scale coastal and traditional fishing ; the drawing up by the commission of a medium - and long - term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries ( including aquaculture ) sector ; and calling for the commission to propose an  |||  action  |||  plan for coastal regions and islands which have an active fisheries sector to improve fuel efficiency in the fisheries and aquaculture sector .

ironically , even  |||  america  |||  's long - term interests would be best served by a commitment -- not just in words , but also in deeds -- to a merit - based system and good governance .

on behalf of the ppe - de group . - madam president , i want to warmly thank anja weisgerber as the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and , of course , as a member of my own group who , once  |||  again  |||  , i think , has shown her mastery of complex , technical dossiers , having also worked very effectively on a number of the emission dossiers as rapporteur for the opinion .
i think one of the careful elements that we have to speak about ( and we can speak about degressive proportionality till the cows come home ) is that there has always been a balance between the different institutions - and also a balance between the larger and smaller member states - to ensure that no one institution would have total domination over  |||  another  |||  , or that larger member states could not dominate medium - sized or small member states .

i voted in favour of the report on eu agriculture and world trade , as it highlights the importance of integrating non - trade concerns into the development of the doha agenda , such as social , environmental and human health considerations , as well as those relating to the health and wellbeing of animals , in order to meet the highest environmental and social standards and avoid a loss of competitiveness  |||  among  |||  eu farmers within the context of world agricultural production .

firstly , we have been working on a communication on a comprehensive strategy for ict to  |||  address  |||  our energy and climate problems .
my  |||  answer  |||  would be that , as an auditor , i would be delighted to give such an opinion when the time came , but it is not the job of auditors to be happy with the opinions that they give .

it is no secret that in the smaller eu states the power of regulators to  |||  adopt  |||  such exceptional measures against large companies will be very limited , and so i am not convinced that in this case parliament is making progress in terms of strengthening the single european market compared with the european commission 's proposal .
mr costa 's draft report has in turn been enriched and improved by a number of  |||  amendments  |||  , many tabled by colleagues from my group .

with the european council meeting last week , the swedish presidency has delivered on all five of its priorities : a strong eu mandate for climate change ; follow - up of the economic and financial crisis ; the eu baltic sea strategy ; the stockholm programme for justice and home affairs ; reinforcing the eu as a global  |||  actor  |||  , including enlargement , and a new external action service .

|||  although  |||  i appreciate the fact that for the first time , the human rights situation in the non - autonomous territories of the western sahara is included , i do not support this report due to the omission of all the above elements and of the negative impact on human rights of the eu free trade agreements , not to mention its unjustified and exaggerated criticism of countries such as cuba and venezuela .

the chinese , in 2001 when they  |||  accepted  |||  the olympic games in 2008 , made commitments to reform .
if we do not ask these difficult - very difficult - questions , we will once  |||  again  |||  be headed for disaster .
the commission will continue to report on all issues covered by the 2005 european council declaration in its next  |||  annual  |||  report .

however , the responsible conduct of this agenda is to be based on the negotiations framework , which has been agreed with croatia , based on the revised accession partnership recently  |||  adopted  |||  by the eu council , and on other legal acts of the european union .

in time , the us had to accept that each political contest or military battle lost was not a watershed as long as its core interests in europe , the far east , and latin  |||  america  |||  were not threatened .

since the political consensus we have reached is not to allow capital losses , why not split the greek debt up and thus  |||  allow  |||  the greek government to manage the future and this mediator basically to sort out the past through restructuring ?
mr moreira 's report was  |||  adopted  |||  today , supporting a commission proposal to authorise the increase in the duty free tariff quota for moldovan wine .
if this trend continues , it will indeed lead to governance by  |||  agency  |||  at the expense , frankly , of the commission , which is our executive and which is accountable to parliament , and much more directly than the agencies , even if we do have more means than mr hannan admitted to control them .

it is crucial that the copenhagen conference results in a politically binding  |||  agreement  |||  .
i agree with the commission 's assessment that this application fulfils the eligibility criteria set by the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) regulation and the commission 's recommendation to the budget authority to approve the application , because only measures that help redundant people to integrate into the labour market are financed with money from the european globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund ( egf ) and money from this fund creates the conditions for redundant workers to find permanent or temporary jobs , to participate in vocational training programmes and to acquire the knowledge necessary to match the needs of the labour market , to acquire a business licence or become self - employed .

we know now -- with multiple revelations about human error and system breakdown on both the  |||  american  |||  and russian sides during the cold war years and since -- that even the most sophisticated command and control systems are not foolproof .
this is something unprecedented and the  |||  african  |||  union is totally powerless to deal with it .

we regret that a majority in this parliament has yet  |||  again  |||  gone back on its word and approved a proposal that takes money out of the progress programme , which was already clearly underfunded for its areas of action in the social field .

that is why i am  |||  again  |||  calling on all the european union governments to help get people home , to make use of every possible means of communication , and to make a special , extraordinary effort to do so , because that is the main right that citizens have : to go home , to go to wherever they want to go .
what is also scandalous is that this will aggravate the brain drain from third countries , especially africa , by capturing their elite and guaranteeing their impoverishment once  |||  again  |||  .
however , we have concerns with some of your  |||  amendments  |||  suggested by the industry committee .
mr president , finally we have a resolution on ukraine  |||  adopted  |||  by our parliament .
( pt ) the large number of activities and sectoral policies on the marine environment - from fishing to maritime transport , and including tourism , energy , science and technology ,  |||  among  |||  others - requires an integrated policy that promotes a beneficial interlinking of all these areas within a framework of sustainability of the marine environment , and of preservation of the related ecosystems .

this is an attack by the big multinationals on the public postal service , the public ownership of this service and the public  |||  administration  |||  that has to provide it , as well as on its democratic nature , attempting to wrest from the power of each people , i.e. from their national sovereignty , the control and power of decision on these crucial issues , which go on to be decided at supranational level by the eu institutions , following interests alien to the people and to portugal .
doing so would reassure  |||  american  |||  taxpayers worried about current deficits .

the main thing is to  |||  adopt  |||  the report now .
view pricing information on value -  |||  added  |||  services for shipping , as well as details on additional charges , extended area surcharge and fuel surcharge .
i believe that the hungarian presidency and the hungarian government has a special role in this , not only in its position of presidency , but also in leading by example , in taking this into  |||  account  |||  in all economic policy changes and all employment policy decisions , and in providing an example to the other countries .
the only variable left to adjust is productivity , which is forced up once again , and once  |||  again  |||  health is compromised .
we owe it to our numerous ties with haiti , ties that are , first and foremost , historic : a former colony , haiti was the most prosperous of them all ; secondly , diplomatic : the cotonou  |||  agreement  |||  makes the island a privileged partner ; and , finally , geographical , since haiti is a neighbour of the european union thanks to the outermost regions .
" risks to global financial stability have eased as the economic recovery has gained steam , but concerns about  |||  advanced  |||  country sovereign risks could undermine gains and prolong the collapse of credit .
|||  according  |||  to this view , the system is unreformable , and real change will be possible only after it finally collapses , perhaps owing to fiscal weakness , since the combination of deficit - financed transfers , low growth , and low labor - market participation may prove unsustainable .
it would be very interesting from this perspective to see what preventative  |||  actions  |||  or preventative steps the office of the high commissioner has prepared in order to avoid this happening , perhaps in cooperation with the un or the african union , on the one hand , and it would be very interesting , of course , to see the method or steps the office would like to take if that does happen , and in the event that north sudan does not comply with the peace agreement which was signed , and which i basically believe in .
the alliance can claim important achievements over the past 15 years : it helped to stabilize europe as it enlarged to 26 members , almost double the cold war number ; it kept the balkan conflict under control ; it even  |||  accepted  |||  a role in extra - european security contingencies such as afghanistan .
if you achieve this , may god reward you , and if not , may he hold you to  |||  account  |||  .
not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of  |||  afghanistan  |||  ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support president hamid karzai 's government and the international community .

|||  although  |||  limited , the progress made will contribute towards a successful outcome to the conference of the parties in copenhagen .
but the current fiscal deficit mainly reflects weak tax revenues , owing to slow growth and high unemployment , and temporary stimulus measures that are fading away at a time when aggregate demand remains weak and  |||  additional  |||  fiscal stimulus is warranted .
european financial support can be crucial in this respect and we must  |||  always  |||  keep in mind that cooperation in the area of health is truly strategic and directly involves not just one of the millennium development goals ( mdg ) but many of them .
since the mid - 1990 's , the net current -  |||  account  |||  surplus of " all the rest " has risen by an amount that one federal reserve bank economist has put at $ 450 billion a year , not because savings rates have increased , but because investment rates have fallen .

as this report says , ' introducing minimum income schemes in all eu member states - consisting of specific measures supporting people ( children , adults and the elderly ) whose income is insufficient by means of a financial contribution and facilitated access to essential public services - is one of the most effective ways to combat poverty , guarantee an  |||  adequate  |||  standard of living and foster social integration ' .
that deficit ,  |||  according  |||  to the latest figures , was gbp 7.2 billion in one year alone .
in wanting to create a single european market for goods and services we forget that perhaps we should take  |||  account  |||  of the social realities in the member states , and when we seek to provide the european union with a proper long - term strategy for energy we forget that this will come at a transition cost , to use the language of the economists , and that when asked what category of consumer will be most affected we can reply that it will be those from the less well - off sections of the community , those who are hit hardest by the increase in fuel prices .
we are pleased with the recent progress made and , in particular , and firstly , the announcement that discussions will begin on 27 october , under the auspices of the united nations and the  |||  african  |||  union special envoy , to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that will increase the prospects for peace in darfur .

madam president , the problems facing  |||  afghanistan  |||  and pakistan are naturally a concern of the whole world .
|||  allow  |||  me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well .
top of the political  |||  agenda  |||  today is the great economic crisis that the country is experiencing , the problem of returning migrants and , of course , violence and organised crime .
two weeks before president george w. bush takes office , the uncertainty that surrounded his election has been replaced by concerns about the impact his presidency will have on  |||  america  |||  's foreign policy .
however , you must be sure that these  |||  amendments  |||  will not create difficulties in the application of the directive by all member states .
i fully  |||  agree  |||  with the demands of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and many human rights organisations that the governments of european states should put pressure on the cuban authorities for the unconditional release of political prisoners , with the threat of blocking every attempt at improving eu - cuba relations .
the union has concluded that , in order for it to be able to maintain its capacity for integration , candidate countries must be prepared to  |||  accept  |||  in full the obligations that ensue for them from accession , and that the union must be able to function effectively and to move forward , as mr brok stressed in his speech .

on behalf of the uen group . - ( lv ) ladies and gentlemen ,  |||  although  |||  relations between the european union and latin america could be described as dynamic , our potential for cooperation is nowhere near being fully exploited .

the  |||  agency  |||  , which is based in lisbon , fittingly , has important competences in this area and deserves to be supported in its demanding work .
there is also a second aspect on which i have placed particular stress , and that is to try to identify specific priorities , or , in other words , to produce a summary of what the basic guiding elements of  |||  action  |||  by the european union with regard to human rights throughout the world might be .

what we must do , what we must analyse and what we must decide naturally concerns how to make the most of and get the greatest benefit from globalisation , while reducing or eliminating all the known risks associated with it and  |||  always  |||  bearing in mind - a very important point for me - that globalisation must be at the service of humankind and citizens rather than the other way round .
|||  action  |||  is needed urgently : vigorous , targeted and comprehensive action in order to restore confidence , growth and jobs and to repair the financial system , to rebuild stability for the future , to promote trade and investment and to better protect our citizens - in short , to deliver an effective and stable financial system .
the council has not taken any specific  |||  action  |||  on this issue .
we hope that this can be done apace , even though , as is  |||  always  |||  the case at the end of negotiations , the dossiers concerned are difficult ones , for example the dossier on shipbuilding .
specific procedures and legislation apply to potentially allergenic foods and i can , therefore , state very clearly that the commission will request the european food safety authority to explicitly  |||  address  |||  the potential allergenic effects of azo colours during the re - evaluation of these food additives .
i should say that a number of the roles we have given to the agency sound more consultative than concrete , but we have tried to create opportunities for innovative regulation by drawing attention to areas where  |||  action  |||  is needed but the agency does not have the appropriate powers to act .
as the council had chosen not to be part of the negotiations on the revised framework  |||  agreement  |||  , we have taken care not to pre - empt on issues that need to be agreed with the council .
|||  america  |||  needs obama , but mccain is a reasonable alternative .
if we allow these countries to gain increased market  |||  access  |||  , it could have detrimental effects not only on european farmers , but also on those developing countries most in need .
the council  |||  agreed  |||  to a revision of the multiannual financial framework so that the galileo project might be financed entirely out of the eu 's budget .
in september 2010 , all united nations member states will come together in new york to discuss the progress made towards the mdgs and  |||  agree  |||  on actions to be taken to ensure that the goals are met .
in the specific case of this instrument , this legislative proposal is aimed solely at a technical  |||  amendment  |||  that will make this instrument more flexible when implementing programmes and projects .
moreover , if we want to have  |||  access  |||  to a structural mechanism for the future , we have to bear in mind one thing : lessons need to be learnt from what has taken place over the last five months .
it is the conscious and not conscious guidance of human  |||  action  |||  , both in the field of individuals and of groups and society .
mr president , may i offer the eu some modest  |||  advice  |||  ?
together with other meps on the left of the house , we tabled an  |||  alternative  |||  motion for a resolution describing the measures and mechanisms needed for a europe which targets economically , socially and environmentally viable growth with full employment and rights for its workers .

in  |||  addition  |||  , issues of the institutional organisation or autonomy of minorities fall within the powers of the member states .
i hope we can  |||  adopt  |||  an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the may summit in madrid , because the european union and mexico need to work together in many areas , both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums , in order to confront challenges and threats together , including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime
premature rejection of bank nationalization has left us with the same two  |||  alternatives  |||  as in 1933 : break - up or regulation .
moreover , the trade  |||  advantages  |||  given to pakistan will be paid for by the european industries most affected , namely the textile industry of southern europe , and also by the poor countries that export the same products to europe , which will suffer from the diversion of european imports to pakistan , for example bangladesh or the countries of north africa .
by not keeping its promises to  |||  allow  |||  peaceful demonstrations and free internet access , china undercut its soft - power gains .
training , which i have mentioned , focuses especially on the fact that if we wish to care for someone who is perhaps close to us , and with whom we have an emotional bond , then despite all our efforts and goodwill , caring for another person is  |||  actually  |||  , in a sense , a specialised field . it is therefore a very good thing for these people to gain some basic knowledge and basic experience , because the results are beneficial for them , too : not only is the standard of care greatly improved , but their task becomes considerably easier .
shockingly , the us is now spending around $ 4 billion per month to station its troops in iraq , while at the same time president bush fights like crazy to keep  |||  america  |||  's contribution to the global fund to fight aids , tb , and malaria to no more than $ 200 million for an entire year .

solvit seems to me to be a viable  |||  alternative  |||  to the judicial route , with the courts also being so clogged up with all kinds of different cases .
( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the european  |||  agencies  |||  are permanently in the crossfire of criticism .
mr president , i  |||  always  |||  try to speak in my own language , but sometimes i feel that i should not on such sensitive issues .
it was thought that keeping inflation low was necessary and  |||  almost  |||  sufficient for growth and stability ; that making central banks independent was the only way to ensure confidence in the monetary system ; that low debt and deficits would ensure economic convergence among member countries ; and that a single market , with money and people flowing freely , would ensure efficiency and stability .
an international treaty that would  |||  adopt  |||  standards similar to those of the eu , but also to those already in place in countries like the us or japan , would still be a most valuable contribution to the current prevailing international standard as defined by the wto trips agreement .
the serbian government accused lithuanian companies , which had invested eur 34 million , of default and , in violation of the  |||  agreement  |||  between serbia and lithuania providing for investment promotion and mutual protection , terminated the privatisation contract .
in this context , it is very disturbing that the chairman of the african union commission , mr konaré , has been insisting on an all -  |||  african  |||  force , even rejecting the integration of units offered by uruguay , thailand and norway into unamid , in contradiction with the un security council decision and , in this way , echoing the manoeuvres of the clique in khartoum .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the policy of protectionism adopted by many countries as a basic tool for fighting the recession is having a disadvantageous effect on trade .
a strange picture of bush emerged from conversations with sub - cabinet  |||  administration  |||  appointees , their friends , and their friends of friends .
the deal was signed and almost everybody was happy : passengers who fly cheaply ; the airport , where the number of shops increased  |||  along  |||  with the number of passengers ; the local community , where new jobs were created .
since its launch in 2000 , the gavi alliance has sought to increase  |||  access  |||  to life - saving vaccines for the world 's poorest children .

instead of seeking a mandate to introduce these cuts , after the imf and the eu had examined the  |||  account  |||  books , the irish government decided that there would be no election until this budget had been enacted .
more importantly , it is directly  |||  accessible  |||  to the public on the europa server .
i hope the council and the other institutions will endorse taiwan 's ambition to be  |||  admitted  |||  as an observer to the world health assembly .
in full respect of subsidiarity , it is for the member states to decide the  |||  actual  |||  conditionality of social housing .
stubbornly high youth unemployment ,  |||  along  |||  with europe 's dwindling numbers of school - leavers , is already canceling out the positive effects of immigration .
|||  another  |||  positive aspect was the agreement reached for the commission to present , by the end of september 2011 at the latest , updated values relating to allocations for cohesion policy and for rural development , and , if necessary , increasing these allocations .
the eu has raised these concerns repeatedly with the chinese authorities and reiterates its concerns in the two declarations published on 29 october and on 13 november , as it  |||  always  |||  does in such situations .
this exercise was simple and consensual , but it was more difficult to reach  |||  agreement  |||  on measures to address the single market fatigue mentioned in the monti report and to achieve the holistic , concerted approach to respond to citizens ' needs and mistrust , which were clearly identified in the grech report adopted by this house in may last year .
i cannot help feeling that russia 's  |||  action  |||  was timed to coincide with the start of the czech presidency , although prime minister and council president - in - office topolánek has shown great skill in handling this emergency .
in short , this  |||  agreement  |||  is , as it stands , pointless and potentially harmful .
this is  |||  another  |||  example of european realpolitik , which you can count us out of .
similarly , regulatory  |||  agencies  |||  are now better equipped to deal with financial irregularities .
parliament proposes much better coordination between the external  |||  action  |||  service , the commission and the bank in implementing the eu 's external policy objectives .
language is an important underlying factor , and in israel , there is the army , while in  |||  america  |||  , the values embodied in the constitution still represent a shared secular faith .
i would therefore appeal to everyone in this house to vote in favour of the  |||  amendments  |||  condemning the united states ' ' global gag rule ' and also the vatican 's ban on condoms - i shall just come out and say it - as these two things are directly responsible for millions of deaths and must , i believe , be condemned by this house .
the interests of big companies and financial institutions , and of the major powers almost  |||  always  |||  overcome the genuine and real interests of solidarity .
where  |||  actions  |||  are brought by qualified entities , the group of victims must be defined in the submission of the application , but the identification of each one can be done later on , although it must be clearly established as soon as possible , avoiding unnecessary delays and complying with the existing legislation .
before the crisis , a substantial  |||  amount  |||  of that money was invested in us , spanish , or irish real estate .
an agreement with all countries that will result in each developed country undertaking to reduce its total emissions , in other words , an economy - wide target ; we need all developed countries to link their commitments to the  |||  agreement  |||  in copenhagen , including the us .
we have just witnessed the commission 's strong commitment to communitising and standardising control , and it would prove difficult to understand the way in which the remaining measures serve , on the contrary , to break up and fragment that control , or the fact that different rules are created for the same  |||  activity  |||  , depending on where it is carried out .
this was in fact the outcome of the vote , with my  |||  agreement  |||  , in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection .
that makes mrs merkel 's  |||  action  |||  yesterday all the more encouraging !
secondly ,  |||  amendments  |||  that delete or water down a very precise and specific reference in the report - that controversial political speech should not be criminalised - are amendments that i oppose , and i am glad to hear that many others in this room do as well .
i welcome recent statements by the commission which detail the disbursement of eu funds to  |||  address  |||  this huge challenge .
during an  |||  address  |||  organised by the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , the permanent representative to the united nations of the somalian transition government , dr yusuf mohamed ismail bari - bari , pointed out that somalia has been further impoverished by fraudulent fishing of its shores and that many of the pirates are also former fishermen who have not received justice or attention .
i believe that all the eu member states should  |||  adopt  |||  action plans of this kind .
if we use alternative methods - we often talk about  |||  alternative  |||  dispute resolution systems at european level - these , again , are not backed by a state structure .

was it a coincidence that the previous item on the  |||  agenda  |||  this afternoon was the situation in egypt ?
it would be a disgrace if anyone  |||  actually  |||  thought along those lines in europe , where the freedom of movement is a fundamental right and a symbol of freedom and equality .

in compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity , the directive , in the  |||  amended  |||  form proposed by parliament , provides the necessary framework which is conducive to narrowing the disparities between women and men involved in self - employed activities .
after months of work , today , we once  |||  again  |||  voted on a text which , although not as ambitious as the one previously rejected by the ppe and alde groups , is quite brave : it allows mothers to maintain their salary during maternity leave ; it increases their legal protection against redundancy ; it allows greater flexibility in terms of working hours in order to better balance motherhood with work ; it extends maternity leave to at least 20 weeks ( although some of us would have liked it to be 24 weeks , as the world health organisation recommends ) ; it facilitates the mobility of working mothers within the eu and it makes progress on joint responsibility for fathers , although not as much as some of us would have liked .
i voted in favour of the resolution on the eures  |||  activity  |||  report 2004-2005 on the contribution of eures to a single european labour market .
in  |||  addition  |||  to this , we should support the elders group , so that its members can obtain permission to enter zimbabwe .

it has been requested that this draft be  |||  amended  |||  as follows :
on active pharmaceutical ingredients : the  |||  agreed  |||  text strengthens inspections and international cooperation in this field .
our decisions on the environment , services , immigration and insurance issues , and dozens of others , also in reality  |||  affect  |||  the lives of these fellow citizens of ours , who are , of course , often the least privileged .
it is indeed essential to renew the  |||  agreement  |||  drawn up with the soviet government years ago .
( nl ) mr president , commissioner , the main challenge is to do things differently - in a much less fragmented way , to have much less parallel  |||  activity  |||  from the member states and the european union - and also to invest in a better - targeted way .
it is right that tonight we agree emergency  |||  action  |||  to speed up european funds to people in need , at a time of need .

|||  although  |||  i voted in favour of this report , i believe this process needs to be monitored carefully .
madam president , as someone who has long opposed fumigation to eradicate drugs as inefficient , often counterproductive and  |||  always  |||  with damaging side effects to human health , i am sorry that this resolution combines this position with what i believe to be a misguided attempt to encourage licit opium production in afghanistan .
since spring 2005 , we have gone from ideas to concept to proposal , and you have  |||  always  |||  been involved .
of course , debt - holders would be obliged to  |||  accept  |||  a uniform discount ( or " haircut " ) on what they are owed .
cohesion policy constitutes one of the targets of the eu 2020 strategy and for this reason it is necessary to pay greater attention to the coordination of  |||  activities  |||  between the eu and the member states which depend on this sector .
i personally , on behalf of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , resolved first of all to focus - and this was ultimately confirmed by the committee - on ensuring that our accession does indeed represent  |||  added  |||  value for citizens of the european union and that the latter are aware of these values and opportunities , although we should also avoid raising exaggerated expectations .
|||  access  |||  to the radio spectrum is essential to ensure that all european citizens , whether in rural or urban areas , have access to digital technologies and broadband , with the total turnover of this industry representing approximately eur 200 billion .
i would have liked to hear from the council whether , and in which form , the territorial  |||  agenda  |||  is to be discussed at the spring summit .
the bush - cheney  |||  administration  |||  , the most pro - israeli in memory , fared no better .
we have a pledge of more money from the imf , a promise of more support for europe 's most troubled economies and an  |||  agreement  |||  on moving ahead with european supervision of the financial system .

the declaration that was  |||  adopted  |||  underlines the member states ' responsibilities with a view to ensuring the meaningful inclusion of the roma , by laying emphasis on the strengthening of people 's individual rights and on the importance of the participation of roma organisations .
to be acceptable to parliament , the package of measures must be sufficiently vigorous for us to achieve the  |||  agreed  |||  eu targets of a 20 % reduction in co2 emissions and a 20 % increase in renewables by the year 2020 - but also to enable us to go further and raise this up to 30 % in the event of an international agreement .
the high percentage of cases completed in which the institution that a complaint referred to came to an  |||  agreement  |||  or the case was resolved to the benefit of the complainant also testifies to the effectiveness of the ombudsman and his good cooperation with other bodies .
such measures include assisting the green movement so that it can maintain access to the internet , introducing  |||  additional  |||  sanctions aimed at the revolutionary guard , and publicly supporting the political and legal rights of the iranian people .
the achievement of these  |||  aims  |||  , along with the successful signing of the economic cooperation agreements with countries from africa , the caribbean basin and pacific ocean region , is also closely linked to the recovery from the financial crisis .
i voted in favour of the resolution relating to the commission 's work programme for 2011 , which is the first to be  |||  adopted  |||  within the framework of the new programming period and should contribute to a deepening of the dialogue between parliament and the commission , with the aim of improving the relationship between political and budget priorities at eu level .

|||  another  |||  glaring pay inequality lies in sectoral gender segregation , as half of jobs in three sectors are male dominated .
rapporteur . - ( fi ) mr president , the report before us has undergone a thorough reading in committee , for which i thank my colleagues and  |||  above  |||  all the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups .
when will we have the european credit rating  |||  agency  |||  ?
in the uk  |||  alone  |||  , we have many prominent uk organisations with campaigns - from the women 's institute to the cooperative society .
it would be useful if the council were in the chamber so that we could address the issue of whether it is willing  |||  actually  |||  to provide the correlation tables that parliament and the commission believe to be essential - and perhaps this is something on which the council could come back to us quite swiftly .
all of this is necessary , but what our fellow citizens expect most of all - and i hope that the commission is listening - is for us to take  |||  action  |||  in response to the crisis .
|||  another  |||  breakdown of the interbank market is therefore very unlikely .
prerequisites for this are an understanding of russia and a common  |||  analysis  |||  , and we therefore support the cooperation of experts on russia across the european union .
i believe that in this final compromise . we have remained true to the original  |||  aims  |||  of rohs , and that we will have a more effective piece of legislation should parliament vote in favour on wednesday .
the council also stated that the eu is opposed to any division whatsoever of the palestinian territories and confirmed that the eu is ready to collaborate with all palestinian parties whose policy and  |||  actions  |||  reflect the principles of the quartet .
in fact , the european external  |||  action  |||  service is perhaps the most visible result of the treaty of lisbon .
why can the council not  |||  accept  |||  that ?
the  |||  alarming  |||  state that the monetary union finds itself in and the fact that the euro has become a high - risk currency are a result of countries such as germany , the netherlands and austria , on the one hand , being brought together with states such as greece , italy and spain , on the other , with a deliberate disregard for the existing differences between them concerning their economic development and the ethos on which their financial policy is based .
in  |||  addition  |||  it could be used for missions abroad ( such as haiti ) .
the regular occurrences of drought in past few years have caused exceptional damage to hungarian agriculture , with the damage last year  |||  alone  |||  amounting to one billion euros .
i will echo comments about the beekeeping sector , but i would remind colleagues that the wild bumble bee population  |||  across  |||  europe is also in a similar - and very grave - situation .
speculation that enriches only those who perform a transaction is very different from the  |||  action  |||  of a business or industry that creates prosperity for many citizens .
all other major economies , including key us allies , have enacted the legislation needed to strengthen the imf ; in the us , however , there has been no comparable  |||  action  |||  since 2010 , owing to congressional resistance .
commission 's position on  |||  amendments  |||  by parliament
|||  although  |||  we support this mobilisation , as it is essential to support these workers , we would like to reiterate our reservations and critical position on this fund , as we believe that it would have been more important to have taken measures to prevent unemployment in the first place .
the default for cards sold in north  |||  america  |||  and most of europe is 3 ; the default for cards sold in france is 11 , and the default for cards sold in japan is 14 .
there have been many laws here that have affected local authorities : on the pitting of the stadtwerke , or municipal utilities , against one  |||  another  |||  , for example ; on public service obligations in the transport sector ; and on the directives on public contracts .
|||  america  |||  's distorted political system gives the rich everything they want in the form of tax cuts , while slashing programs for the poor .
we need to be clear about people 's identity in order to  |||  allow  |||  them to have access to schools , social welfare , health care and housing .
however , the report from 2009 also shows that  |||  almost  |||  40 % of questions raised by citizens related to residence conditions in another eu country .
i join with the commissioner in admiring the  |||  actions  |||  taken by the european central bank .
|||  almost  |||  one in five hoped that unemployment would be addressed .
thank you for supporting the commission 's  |||  action  |||  plan and for your commitment to community air transport policy .
, on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( de ) mr president , allow me to read out the wording : ' points to the potentially heightened risks involved in long - distance transport of live  |||  animals  |||  and , in this context , takes the view that more frequent thorough inspections should be conducted in order to ensure that only completely healthy animals are transported and believes that consideration should be given to the question whether the transport of animals for slaughter or fattening ' - and this is the difference - ' can be limited to a maximum journey time of nine hours ' .
greater synergies in practice mean that  |||  actions  |||  financed by the various cohesion policy funds are prepared , designed and implemented within the framework of an integrated common plan , so that each action uses and complements the positive results of other actions .
we have achieved maximum  |||  access  |||  for disabled users as well as a review of the scope of universal service in order to extend it in particular to mobiles by next year .
at the same time , however , as an mep , i cannot but  |||  agree  |||  with mrs pack and mrs bildt that true european solidarity involves the european union providing logistical help in meeting criteria rather than deviating from them , as this has a demoralising effect on societies and absolves governments of responsibility .
it is an irony that , only eight years ago , the millennium development goals were  |||  agreed  |||  upon in new york .
but he was able to work with the council 's president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to  |||  allow  |||  his team to address the actions taken byboth parties to the conflict .
i would appreciate an  |||  answer  |||  to this question .
as a final note , i should say that the eu should not be simplistic by putting the issue to iran with reference only to its nuclear programme , but should also take  |||  account  |||  of human rights issues and the stabilising potential of the country in the region .
the international aid effectiveness agenda embodied in the paris declaration and the accra agenda for  |||  action  |||  is now more important than ever .
while iran may not be ready to change its relationship with  |||  america  |||  , even an unsuccessful us attempt to reach out has merit .
as a result , parliament has  |||  accepted  |||  a more flexible timetable for implementing and interconnecting national electronic registers ( 31 december 2012 ) .
kemalism ( the beliefs associated with the founder of modern turkey , musfafa kemal atutűrk ) is unique  |||  among  |||  all muslim reform movements in that it transformed not only the public sphere , but also the private sphere -- the domain of mothers , wives , sisters , daughters .
since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year ,  |||  america  |||  and the eu recognize ( or say that they do ) that the lack of legitimate channels of opposition in arab countries pushes people who might otherwise be mere critics of governments into the arms of extreme islamic fundamentalists .
similarly , to ensure that the aid takes the form of long - term and predictable financing , it is vital to release  |||  additional  |||  resources by means of innovative financing mechanisms and to mobilise sovereign wealth funds for productive investment .
this is the conclusion of the report  |||  adopted  |||  by the european parliament on space and the security of the eu .
no , unfortunately , the protection of human rights in this  |||  agreement  |||  is as naked as the famous emperor .
in these circumstances , we need collective  |||  action  |||  for global recovery along four main policy lines : repair , reform , rebalancing , and rebuilding .
it is not enough to give money ; the eu should also be able to take rapid  |||  action  |||  in this kind of catastrophic situation , to provide assistance and send people over there .
the smallest  |||  agencies  |||  have more difficulty in following the onerous procedures imposed by eu legislation .
i also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , hubert pirker , in particular the amendment on the need for transparency and information in relation to the  |||  activities  |||  and recommendations of this network , which must result in the presentation of an annual report to the commission and the european parliament .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , laundry , dry cleaning , ironing service , bridal suite , currency exchange , car rental , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
booking.com : cancelli rossi hotel rome  |||  airport  |||  , fiumicino , italy - 163 guest reviews .
to reply to mrs mcguinness , i think that the response from the g20 , the way it was prepared , the fact that there is an  |||  action  |||  plan agreed by the g20 , shows that the council was united in its action .
in the cases of some ietis , for example , we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies , and once  |||  again  |||  , small businesses have been left out .
many  |||  accidents  |||  have been contributed to sleep deprivation because of excessive working hours , namely the paddington rail crash .
i believe that our efforts must be directed at the  |||  african  |||  union and the governments of the nations it consists of .
if we are honest about the causes of the 2008 crisis -- and serious about avoiding its recurrence -- we must accept what economic  |||  analysis  |||  cannot deliver in order to benefit from what it can .
second ,  |||  again  |||  as the skeptics warned , over - claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong .
i also wanted to ensure that the ample financial resources disbursed by the european commission were subjected to closer scrutiny , particularly in the context of the european year in 2010 , in order to establish whether they served as an instrument of fairer distribution or whether they might  |||  actually  |||  be helping to make the rich richer and scarcely ever reaching those below the poverty line .
this goes without saying , and even those who are not members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs will  |||  agree  |||  that it is vital .
like millions of  |||  americans  |||  , i was mesmerized by the collapse of a country where half - a - million american soldiers fought and 50,000 died .
jean monnet has an  |||  answer  |||  for this too .
i should like to say something about a group of  |||  adults  |||  who could benefit from this learning : because there are adults of the first , second and third ages .
as you know , the commission adopted an action plan for nanosciences and nanotechnology for europe 2005-2009 and parliament adopted a resolution on it , in which the  |||  action  |||  plan was well received .
furthermore , mr barroso , since you expressed your  |||  admiration  |||  and your acknowledgement , perhaps , at some time in the future , the european union could give belgium a nudge in the right direction or a bit of a helping hand .
personally , i am in favour of amendment 57 tabled by the socialist group and  |||  amendment  |||  59 tabled by the greens , but i oppose amendments 58 and 60 .
madam president , all the speeches made by the members who have spoken before me - whom i thank , starting with the rapporteur - as well as the documentation presented by the rapporteur herself , which underlines the fact that our proposals , had they been  |||  accepted  |||  , would not have unleashed a trade war , have shown that there was no collective failure , and i repeat this to the hungarian presidency without wishing to be polemical .
i support this  |||  agreement  |||  negotiated between the european community and barbados , establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens .
nonetheless , the preference given to short circuits (  |||  although  |||  they are not described as such ) , the priority given to renewable energy sources , the review of costly irrigation systems or even the mitigation of the effects of climate change being described as a ' public good ' are too many concessions to our arguments to be ignored .
the directive on  |||  airport  |||  charges aims to prevent potential abuses by airports enjoying a dominant position on the union 's market or in particular countries .
therefore , what the european council is proposing , mrs carlotti , is that each member state should at least confirm the commitment that it assumed , if you remember , in 2005 , and  |||  agree  |||  to produce a transitional plan illustrating how they can reach the target set for 2010 and 2015 .
however , paragraph 13 is confusing and muddled and does not  |||  actually  |||  mean anything .
secondly , we have  |||  adopted  |||  a ' follow the needs ' approach and are providing assistance where people are , in order to prevent further mass movements .
on behalf of the ppe group . - madam president , the goal in  |||  afghanistan  |||  was to fight the taliban , who offered a safe haven to al-qaeda .
as we have heard from several of you , she has been working very closely with parliament and has  |||  always  |||  looked for parliament 's involvement on different issues .
|||  although  |||  the union was created to safeguard peace in europe , i must highlight the radicalisation of the situation in hungary .
there are still euro - enthusiasts , but  |||  among  |||  the peoples of europe indifference and , in some places , mild hostility , prevails .
member of the commission . - madam president , i would first of all  |||  agree  |||  with james elles about a greater strategic dialogue with a great strategic partner .
i want to remind honourable members that  |||  almost  |||  all of the trade and cooperation agreements which we have concluded since 1995 have included a human rights clause , and that exists in agreements with , i believe now , 134 countries .
their bodies were then chopped up , covered in quicklime , burnt , buried , dug up , and buried  |||  again  |||  in an unmarked pit .
i endorsed this document because , on 14 june 2010 , the commission published its  |||  action  |||  plan on global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) applications , which included 24 specific recommendations for action .
in october 2006 , the council  |||  adopted  |||  strategic guidelines on cohesion to act as reference points for the member states in drafting their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes for 2007-2013 .
baroness ashton , you said there will be duty - free and quota - free  |||  access  |||  , which is fine , but the issue is that the agreements that have been signed with central america , and subsequently with mercosur and the andean pact countries , will reduce the tariffs for them , and nothing we do is going to make it possible for banana producers in the acp to remain competitive .
in  |||  addition  |||  , another crucial question is assistance in maintaining order and in rebuilding a disaster - hit country .
cambridge -- emerging - market equities and exchange rates are  |||  again  |||  under severe downward pressure , but are the underlying economies really as fragile as global traders seem to fear ?
so long as the two central banks behave this way and as the two regions are subjected to highly different choices ( which , as a matter of fact , will be so indefinitely ) ,  |||  american  |||  and european interest rates will each continue to evolve on different paths , and their exchange rates will keep fluctuating .
for ukraine , europe can help by embracing the free - trade  |||  agreement  |||  that we are now negotiating .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the report adopted , particularly because the application of the principle of mutual recognition of plant protection product authorisations will end the competitive imbalances that exist between different member states ( with different sizes of market ) and will especially reduce environmental and food safety concerns .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( ga ) madam president , agriculture should not lose out in a world trade organisation  |||  agreement  |||  .
|||  another  |||  reason for error messages similar to the ones above could be a file in /etc/modprobe.d supplying a device_mode parameter when it is n't required .
there is no clear indication so far that an eu - collective redress system brings  |||  added  |||  value to the internal market and its consumers and businesses .
however , the proportionality principle also has to be balanced with  |||  another  |||  principle , which is equally dear to parliament - namely that of subsidiarity .
i think the best  |||  alternative  |||  is the security council .
madam president , i would like to express my concern regarding the situation of banana producers in the canary islands , guadeloupe , martinique and madeira , which the treaty include  |||  among  |||  the outermost regions .
in view of this , i am in  |||  agreement  |||  with the decisions that have been established by the rapporteur and have decided to vote in favour of the report .
it was balanced report that was much improved at the voting stage by the  |||  amendments  |||  of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , which were accepted with the decisive contribution of liberals and conservatives .
|||  although  |||  the public 's outrage at his tactics makes a comeback unlikely , menem still dreams of retreating with his defeated troops and reshaping himself from an alternative power base .
the hotel also includes free internet  |||  access  |||  in public areas and free parking on - site .
but once the new government takes office , germany 's continued refusal to  |||  adopt  |||  an active approach to solving europe 's problems would be entirely indefensible .
any delivery charges are indicated to the user as and its choice of products ( see shopping ) and it is invoiced at the end of the order in  |||  addition  |||  to the price of selected products .
the challenge is to preserve and strengthen what we have  |||  achieved  |||  in that time and to find ways of defending our interests and projecting our common values beyond our borders .
it is important for member states to abide by the scheduled timeframes and to include additional  |||  activities  |||  in the rural development programmes , thereby allowing these funds to be used .
the main effect of this directive will be to provide comparable and standard information to consumers  |||  across  |||  the eu who take out loans .
it was necessary to have , on such a sensitive issue , a firm political indication from the ep towards the european council , showing that national interests can be overcome to  |||  agree  |||  on a better system than the one laid down by the nice treaty .
in  |||  addition  |||  , all these measures would apply retroactively from 1 august 2006 .
in an almost unbelievable volte face , for reasons that remain somewhat mysterious , obama 's  |||  administration  |||  itself shot down this approach . " if enacted , brown - kaufman would have broken up the six biggest banks in america , " a senior treasury official said .
as regards the specific situation of older people , ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities , the council has already  |||  adopted  |||  legislation aiming to protect these and other vulnerable groups from discrimination .
the world order no longer consists of these two powers  |||  alone  |||  ; there are also emerging powers like china .
we must show determination and push forward with the internal reconciliation process in  |||  afghanistan  |||  and include moderate members of the taliban .
my second request is for much greater transparency with regard to the competitors on the international market outside the eu , which have constantly made a political issue out of their ratings and have suggested that they have an omniscience that in no way corresponds to what is  |||  actually  |||  happening on the market or even their importance .
25,000 tunisians cannot be  |||  allowed  |||  to take 502 million europeans hostage , but these questions will not go away and public support for schengen in europe will be jeopardised .
|||  access  |||  to space for aquaculture has indeed been identified as a key obstacle to the development of aquaculture and marine spatial planning can play a role in addressing this issue .
beautiful and very elegant lay down faceted crystal and english sterling hand hammered perfume scent bottle . this item measures 5 3/8 " long and 1 1/2 "  |||  across  |||  .
i voted for  |||  amendment  |||  1 submitted by the group of european socialists , which requests the commission to guarantee , under the principle of loyal cooperation , equal treatment for all member states citizens as regards the visa waiver .
we will also allow groups that disagree with it to table an  |||  alternative  |||  motion for a resolution , but we will not start voting for hours on hours , paragraph by paragraph , to redraft a committee report of that sort .
as mr salafranca pointed out earlier , it is quite correct that , on 6 november , parliament 's committee on foreign affairs  |||  adopted  |||  two proposals on israel 's participation in community programmes : one was an assent , and the other a resolution .
now these  |||  activities  |||  are to be transferred to the guarantee fund , over which parliament has less power of scrutiny .
author . - mr president , time and time  |||  again  |||  this house has passed resolutions condemning the tragedy that is zimbabwe .
first , legislation  |||  alone  |||  will not solve this problem .
the committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective  |||  amendments  |||  .
this means that , in the case of a significant incident , particularly in a country where few member states are represented , one or two member states can take the lead in coordinating  |||  action  |||  in matters of protection and evacuation .
it is true that we want to expose this , too , through such transparency , but perhaps he will also  |||  agree  |||  with me that not much money is finding its way into european agriculture and europe 's rural areas ; some of it is flowing into the wrong channels .
how can nations with long and illustrious military histories , such as britain and france ,  |||  adopt  |||  such a nonsensical policy ?
serious and transparent lobbying  |||  activities  |||  help to enhance the efficiency of the decision - making process .
this crisis has revealed the eu 's weak spots and more clearly shown what  |||  amendments  |||  are necessary to european union legislation , including the treaty on the functioning of the european union , with respect to the stability mechanism for euro area countries .
president clinton  |||  announced  |||  the accord ; israeli prime minister ehud barak and plo chairman yasir arafat signed nothing .
i call on the house to vote in favour of  |||  amendment  |||  263 , which states that it must be compulsory to list palm oil in foods which our fellow citizens find on supermarket shelves , so that our fellow citizens do not fund global deforestation , loss of biodiversity and climate change without wanting to do so and without knowing that they are doing so .
isolation , sanctions or any other forms of boycott would be harmful to talks and negotiations  |||  aimed  |||  at achieving a sustainable solution to the conflict .
it is  |||  always  |||  a product , but it is more than a product because it carries meaning and purpose .
the conference of the parties to cites will once  |||  again  |||  have to adopt more crucial decisions to protect species threatened by over - exploitation , to which international trade could be contributing .
consequently , the framework  |||  agreement  |||  with libya can only have the consent of this parliament if certain conditions are met .
were the tremendous social and economic differences  |||  across  |||  europe taken into account when debating the important issues i just referred to ?
it is important for me to take  |||  advantage  |||  of the 10th anniversary of this key event in european integration to pay homage , in my turn , to those men who created the euro , such as pierre werner , helmut kohl , françois mitterrand , jacques delors , valéry giscard d'estaing and others .
we can be pleased about this , but it must be ensured that the fund is  |||  accessible  |||  to all those who might benefit from it .
|||  among  |||  other things :
i regret the adoption of the principle of the maximum use of flexibilities set out in the declaration amending the trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights  |||  agreement  |||  ( trips agreement ) and access to medicines , given the lack of any serious evaluation of these mechanisms .
last week , the government accepted a legislative  |||  amendment  |||  concerning the national language which , according to the government , does not affect the minorities ' language use ; however , the bill itself suggests otherwise .
this new situation leads to two problems : increased costs arising from the need for more assistants , and  |||  additional  |||  space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions .
i think that our efforts really brought us close to an  |||  agreement  |||  , and my fear is that this possibility will not arise .
we need to develop a proactive broad energy diplomacy  |||  aimed  |||  at strengthening our cooperation with all major producer , transit and consumer countries , and to create an energy market based on the principle of reciprocity .
this is how the maastricht treaty and the nice treaty were  |||  achieved  |||  , and now the eu is following the same tactic and forcing ireland to vote again on the lisbon treaty when it has already rejected it , as did france and the netherlands .
the next  |||  american  |||  leader
if we want to promote renewable energy or energy produced from renewable sources , producers of this kind of energy need to be able to  |||  access  |||  the power supply grid so that they can reach the end - consumer .
on the latter point , i would emphasise the importance of the commission 's policy study analysing the effectiveness , impact and practical feasibility of a system of this type : we need to have  |||  access  |||  to an objective assessment of its usefulness and of its real , not just assumed , added value .
reporting on energy investment projects once every two years will  |||  allow  |||  the european commission to prepare a regular analysis which will define the subsequent development of the european union 's energy system .
in writing . - healthcare for roma has been systematically denied or rarely taken into consideration  |||  across  |||  europe , despite the fact that access to healthcare is a fundamental right for european citizens .

either way , your  |||  actions  |||  determine what happens to the lawn .
the cost of transport for orders  |||  above  |||  1000 zł .
whilst i  |||  agree  |||  with the idea of further cooperation with turkey and russia to resolve certain ongoing conflicts and to strengthen the links between the black sea countries , the wording of paragraph 39 could lead to confusion .
the  |||  annual  |||  cost of road traffic congestion in the eu is about 1 % of gdp ;
the  |||  agency  |||  amphora holiday sardinia offer its customers the rental of apartments , houses or villas for one week , selecting the structures according to their distance from the sea and the feasibility .
indeed , the fact that neither the global biodiversity objective set for 2010 , namely , the sharp reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss , nor the eu objective to halt biodiversity loss , has been achieved makes the  |||  additional  |||  actions aimed at achieving these objectives even more urgent .
i also believe it essential that fulfilling eu waste legislation in campania and in other regions of europe demands a major effort to reduce the volume of waste and tip the balance towards the prevention , reduction , re - use and recycling of waste by providing  |||  adequate  |||  infrastructure , and that greater emphasis must be placed on the recycling of organic waste , particularly in this markedly agricultural region .
the spread of nuclear weapons is unquestionably  |||  among  |||  the greatest threats to global security .
and it is europe and  |||  america  |||  that are marching , alone and together , to the denouement of a grand debacle .
to its credit , the british egg industry  |||  accepted  |||  the situation , and developed new and less cruel methods of keeping hens .
|||  allow  |||  me to finish simply by saying that trade union and social rights and collective agreements must never be viewed as administrative barriers .
in  |||  addition  |||  , strong economic interaction would provide more opportunities to strengthen the eu 's regional integration and would create more possibilities for the eu to contribute to increasing the stability of this strategically important region .
a uk - eu free trade  |||  agreement  |||  would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the uk as a member of the eu , and would therefore require far less negotiation ( e.g. over tariff reductions ) than did the agreement with south korea .
it is because netanyahu is driven by an  |||  almost  |||  messianic determination to prevent iran from acquiring the means to destroy israel , that he might be amenable to a fundamental change in his position on palestine , provided obama makes visible headway in his drive to stop iran 's nuclear program .
i recall that , on 7 october 2010 , parliament  |||  adopted  |||  the decision not to discharge the 2008 accounts of the european police college by 618 votes to 0 , with seven abstentions .
( bg ) mr. president , commissioner , the united  |||  action  |||  of different political groups in defence of human rights and dignity are an example of the maturity of our parliament .
we believe that the  |||  annual  |||  reports will continue to reflect the efforts of the european parliament in this regard .
in writing . - ( pl ) we should welcome the fact that by a large majority , the house has  |||  adopted  |||  the report on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
on the contrary , the proliferation of complex national quotas and qualitative restrictions in member states is undermining the lisbon strategy , which  |||  aims  |||  to ensure flexible markets and a mobile labour force .
victims covered by measures stipulating the distance to be observed by their aggressors will be protected beyond national borders , thus  |||  allowing  |||  them to start a new life wherever they see fit .
of course the council is  |||  always  |||  looking , together with the european commission , for ways to enhance the effectiveness and the visibility of eu action .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the kratsa - tsagaropoulou report and in particular welcome the  |||  additional  |||  role given to the european maritime safety agency .
in writing . - i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur on the importance of innovation , especially in demanding sectors such as health , ageing and security .
member states should not be  |||  allowed  |||  to allocate newly freed - up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market .
with a city budget of  |||  almost  |||  $ 50 billion , luzhkov encouraged architectural vandalism , overlooked giant traffic jams , and saw his wife become the richest woman in russia through her moscow construction projects .
i further propose that member countries  |||  agree  |||  to use the imf 's gold reserves to guarantee the interest payments and repayment of the principal .
when i ask this question , i never get a coherent  |||  answer  |||  ; so let me retrace keynes 's steps .
furthermore , according to the dublin - based european foundation , it has at least doubled in  |||  almost  |||  all the member states , and increased fivefold in denmark , italy , spain and sweden - there being an increasing number of european businesses that have recourse to it in order to find workers meeting their specific requirements .
the government erected trade barriers and  |||  adopted  |||  other measures to protect china 's agriculture , but this reflects its concern for factory workers , not - as in the us and europe - farmers ' political clout .
( el ) madam president , commissioner , the budget is a political instrument , not an accounting instrument , and this report has the great  |||  advantage  |||  , i believe , of going beyond technicalities and making some political points .
otherwise , however , we were in  |||  agreement  |||  in the committee on employment and social affairs .
there is a danger , though , that the additional income will be intercepted by intermediate  |||  agencies  |||  ; in other words , a rise in food prices causes a disproportionate rise in the cost of the agricultural production method .
it is those who do not have clean water , those threatened by malaria , those suffering from hiv and ,  |||  above  |||  all , the poorest women and children of the world who are now having to pay the price .
( sk ) madam president , we are dealing with  |||  another  |||  highly sensitive topic and , in my opinion , the european parliament must resolve it , the commission must resolve it and the council must resolve it , because roma inclusion is now no longer possible at the eu member state level alone .
everything points in the direction of determined and united european  |||  action  |||  .
i will vote in favour of this report for the very reason that i believe that more information and ,  |||  above  |||  all , simpler information , can bring the complex world of eu cohesion policy closer to the world of enterprise .

concerning the voluntary pension fund , which is a supplementary pension scheme financed jointly by the mep and the employer , i  |||  agree  |||  with the publication of the names of beneficiaries and with the fact that the reform of this pension scheme should take place alongside the reform of the members ' statute .
it continues that the study foreseen in article 6 ( 5 ) ( a ) of the ecolabel regulation , dealing with  |||  additional  |||  aspects such as processing , pre - packaging , packaging and transport , which will examine the feasibility of the extension of the scope of the ecolabel regulation to food , including products of fishing and aquaculture , will not influence or pre - judge the adoption of this regulation .
to this end , i am very pleased with the  |||  agency  |||  's creation of an internal audit capability ( iac ) that is dedicated to providing support and advice on internal control .
in 2004 , the french worked 28 % fewer hours per person than  |||  americans  |||  , and the germans and dutch each put in 25 % fewer hours , and the money they earned was correspondingly lower -- almost 30 % less income per person than americans received .
of course , iceland , as a member of the eea , has had a major  |||  advantage  |||  in that they have already adopted a significant part of the acquis .
to this end , and to reflect this , the competitiveness council is preparing to  |||  adopt  |||  the council 's conclusions at its previously mentioned meeting on 30-31 may 2011 , about which the presidency is submitting a draft to the council .
reporting bugs requires a valid email  |||  address  |||  .
our committee held very vigorous debates about the reports being presented today , with more than 200  |||  amendments  |||  , 40 compromise amendments and two hearings for experts and stakeholders , all in close cooperation with the committee on women 's rights and gender equality .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , business centre , babysitting / child services , laundry , dry cleaning , barber / beauty shop , breakfast in the room , ironing service , currency exchange , souvenirs / gift shop , bicycle rental , shoe shine , car rental , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
ladies and gentlemen , since my time spent talking is beginning to border on impoliteness , i will mention only briefly that the topics of the hungarian presidency also include the discussion of family policy and the demographic situation , and i would be pleased if hungary could , without provoking interinstitutional debates , contribute to the european union forming a clear and firm position on the freedom of religion and taking  |||  action  |||  against the persecution of christians , which is an important issue for the coming six months .
development of the necessary civil and military capabilities , european union battlegroups , rapid response force initiatives and european defence  |||  agency  |||  programmes constitute important advances which are , however , still inadequate .
so do we not want to disseminate our successes  |||  across  |||  the eu ?
in my view it is necessary to ensure that the financial appropriations for the 2008 annual action programmes for argentina and brazil , specifically earmarked for the promotion of economic development and welfare , are actually used for both education and concrete  |||  action  |||  in the field and that they provide infrastructure and means of production geared to sustainable development .
for weeks the bush administration kept the report on abuses in iraqi prisons from the  |||  american  |||  people by pressuring cbs not to air the photographs in its possession .
copenhagen is important because god 's creation is highly vulnerable , and is deeply affected by man 's  |||  actions  |||  .
additional costs also arise as a result of the associated problems for these conditions , as patients tend not to get  |||  additional  |||  physical complaints looked at and often have a self - denying reaction to medical treatment .
the european union is currently negotiating a very important trade  |||  agreement  |||  , the anti - counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) , and once again , this is being done in back rooms .
we need to ensure transparency and  |||  adequate  |||  risk management , measures on which are part of my proposal on capital requirements .
there is one thing that we should , of course , always take into  |||  account  |||  in this context , and this has been mentioned several times today , namely that , although the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable , it was not pronounced by the government , but by the judicial system .
we  |||  adopted  |||  an eu directive protecting consumers from unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising back in 2005 .
however , i should like to join those who have pointed out that the  |||  agenda  |||  does not end there .
in writing . - ( pl ) i voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a decision of the council and the representatives of the governments of the member states of the european union , meeting within the council , on the conclusion and temporary implementation of the air transport  |||  agreement  |||  between the european community and its member states , on the one hand , and the united states of america , on the other hand ( 8044/3/2007 - - c6-0210/2007 - .
the sum of eur 50 million was therefore  |||  adopted  |||  by parliament during the vote on its reading of the budget on 20 october 2010 .
|||  although  |||  the commission agreed with the proposal initially , it wanted to put only eur 280 million into that fund .
this increased political will , whether in all the policies of the eu and the member states , or in specific actions to give greater visibility to women so that equality is  |||  achieved  |||  along with social progress , makes this a key contribution , and we hope that four years from now - as the commissioner has said - we can achieve a positive balance out of the work that we have carried out , with parliament , the commission and the council .
the direction of increase is mainly google has  |||  always  |||  been the pursuit of speed , while the speed increase will bring about further enhancement of the accuracy and completeness .
|||  although  |||  any boot loader ( e.g. lilo ) should work , it 's convenient to use syslinux , since it uses a fat16 partition and can be reconfigured by just editing a text file .
this is also the reason that i - that is , mr blokland - have joined in signing the  |||  amendment  |||  rejecting the commission proposal .
indeed , france has opened its public educational system to an extraordinary degree , refusing all group rights to minorities , but vigorously affirming personal rights , including full  |||  access  |||  to all social services , regardless of language , religion , or skin color .
we must also make sure that member states invest in social security and social protection systems as well as guaranteeing  |||  access  |||  to rights , resources and universal services .
my colleagues will speak on more technical aspects , but i want to take this opportunity to thank the commissioner and ,  |||  above  |||  all , to express my support for everything he is doing in this regard : he was one of the forerunners and one of the first people to talk about climate change here in brussels .
the different proposals will undoubtedly be debated in parliament and they will clearly be  |||  amended  |||  on many occasions but , nonetheless , they are real proposals which can be discussed .
so , as you can see , first there is a modifier , then a key ( then a modifier and key  |||  again  |||  if you wish to have a longer sequence ) and finally a colon with an action .
i also  |||  agree  |||  on promoting the exchange of information between the european groupings of territorial cooperation ( egtc ) that have already been created , as well as those in the process of being set up within the framework of existing programmes .
the value of these meetings stems from the fact that they  |||  allow  |||  greater concentration on regional problems .
the  |||  amendment  |||  means that both time and money will be saved , and thousands fewer tonnes of co2 will be released into the atmosphere .
in respect of the centre 's  |||  activities  |||  , the court of auditors found that there was a certain lack of precision in the forecasts for translation requests received , which led the centre to have an accumulated budget surplus contrary to regulation ( ec ) no 2965/94 .
mr president , mrs fischer boel , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased i am at the responsibility shown this morning by the house when it  |||  adopted  |||  the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under article 186 of the single cmo regulation , along with many other agricultural products .
we have seen the wmd commission led by hans blix , the new  |||  agenda  |||  coalition , and norway 's seven nation initiative .
i am also willing to bet that this parliament will discuss this instrument  |||  again  |||  in the foreseeable future , because what we are deciding on now will not be enough to break down this power and the dominant position of some large energy companies .
a major drug route passes from  |||  afghanistan  |||  through central asia and into russia and europe .
my answer is that neither should  |||  accept  |||  them for settlement and they should sooner or later be returned to north africa .
at present we are not  |||  always  |||  sure about that , and want the country to move ahead .
the result that has been  |||  achieved  |||  is a lot better than the disadvantages of the compromise , but i want to point out , as the rapporteur , mrs hassi , did , that the major drawback with this is the absence of sanctions , at european level and at a minimal level , and also that at this stage , the regulation is not included in the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law , either in respect of illegal harvesting or in the trade associated with it .
we cannot sit back , however , as someone suggested , but must make sure that these rules are adopted quickly by the member states , which have 24 months at most to do so ,  |||  although  |||  we hope some of them may take less time .
are we going to sit back and  |||  allow  |||  foreign imports to take over our markets and put our industry out of business ?
|||  although  |||  the unified field of reality includes its most abstract , it is impossible to really understand if it does not its most concrete .
|||  although  |||  , i must say that the current greek government is not in any way responsible for the situation .
please  |||  answer  |||  this question for me .
i refused to withdraw the proposal from the council , hoping that with the new report that we will produce and adopt as the commission early next year we will have a new debate which will  |||  allow  |||  us to go on with amendments ; maybe we are now also having new ideas , maybe a broader scope of amendments to this fund .
europe cannot do this  |||  alone  |||  .
i  |||  agree  |||  with this draft council decision on the conclusion of the interim economic partnership agreement between the european community and two pacific states - papua new guinea and the republic of the fiji islands - for the following reasons : 1. these countries are the region 's largest economies and have signed economic partnership agreements with the eu in the past ; 2. despite the potential benefit of extending this partnership to other countries in the region , it has not been possible to do so ; 3. this is an interim agreement which this house will need to reassess if we intend to convert it into a comprehensive one ; 4. the republic of the fiji islands has made commitments to the eu regarding human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law ; 5. in spite of the criticisms made by members of civil society and politicians in the region , this partnership could contribute to these countries ' strategic development .
i now welcome the fact that the commission has said that it is bringing in  |||  additional  |||  funding , but will the rules for any new edctp budget provisions permit funding to be directed to the development and building of clinical trial sites , including epidemiology studies ?
the eu european external action service can carry out its  |||  activities  |||  effectively , relying moreover on the acknowledged sensitivity of member states , but we need a comprehensive and decisive policy that has the necessary bite when required .
the greek statistical data , which ,  |||  according  |||  to the news , were biased and did not reflect the reality of the economy , were an important warning for people to take measures to prevent situations like this one from taking place in the future .
it is not only studies paid by public money that should be publicly  |||  accessible  |||  , but all data related to risk assessment , in conformity with the aarhus convention and the eu law currently applying .
with regard to climate change , in theory , the intention is not to have a detailed discussion at the european council , since the environment council already  |||  adopted  |||  , on 14 october , a very comprehensive text with conclusions establishing the european position .
what we need is research and data : we need an eu - wide data bank where we can  |||  actually  |||  share best practice and make things better for somebody who is trying to lead a normal life but cannot drive a car , cannot ride a motorcycle and cannot get on with their ordinary life , and yet is perfectly intelligent .
even the original member states committed to honour this principle when they welcomed  |||  among  |||  them the 12 new member states .
earlier , the issues of the rating  |||  agencies  |||  and the stress tests were raised .
the committee  |||  adopted  |||  my report on the european judicial network unanimously .
i will conclude by saying that ,  |||  among  |||  other things , we can no longer view immigration as a panacea .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the commission will complete this impact assessment with a more focused economic study in the months to come .
|||  although  |||  president kibaki has ordered these provisions to be amended a week later , we are not aware as to what these ' amendments ' envisage .
in our opinion , the principles of the energy charter treaty and the text on worldwide energy security adopted by the g8 in saint petersburg must be included in the new eu - russia  |||  agreement  |||  which will be legally binding and will replace the current partnership and cooperation agreement ( pca ) .
the egf is  |||  aimed  |||  at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in helping them have access to new employment in the future .
i  |||  agree  |||  that too much time and money is spent on translating debates and documents into the 23 official languages of our union .
we need to spend less , but spend better , not each one of us  |||  alone  |||  at home , under the threat of sanctions , but all together .
as you already know , ladies and gentlemen , not only am i pleased to be back here in brussels for the second time as vice president , as you probably know , some  |||  american  |||  politicians and american journalists refer to washington dc as the capital of the free world .
|||  according  |||  to recent data , online university courses have already reached students in more than 190 countries , enabling them to watch lectures , take quizzes , and interact with fellow students and professors .
by this i mean a european loan , of an  |||  amount  |||  equivalent to eur 1 700 billion , raised by the banking sector .
however , it is worth mentioning that we should also  |||  answer  |||  the question as to which states are using the microfinance facility .
nevertheless ,  |||  although  |||  the new radio and television laws are welcome advances , freedom of expression and , more specifically , freedom of the press , remain a cause for concern .
the  |||  agreement  |||  for scientific and technological cooperation between the european community and ukraine was signed in copenhagen on 4 july 2002 and came into force on 11 february 2003 .
likewise , addressing weak competitiveness and current -  |||  account  |||  imbalances requires currency adjustments that may eventually lead some members to exit the eurozone .
here in brussels , where the largely north  |||  african  |||  immigrant population comprises a quarter of the city 's inhabitants , hotels and restaurants recently resorted to an emergency on - line recruitment service to counter their worsening staff shortages .
the judiciary is  |||  another  |||  key democratic institution .
thirdly , for historical and cultural reasons , i have a lot of sympathy for the sentiments in serbia right now and i believe that , for this reason , we need to be patient as we  |||  allow  |||  serbia to find its way to the european union , and that we must support that process .
in this connection , i wish to take the opportunity to ask the commission and the council a very straight question : do they  |||  agree  |||  with - and would they support - a move to allow homosexual couples to have the right to adopt children in the same way as heterosexual couples , or would they consider that the right of an adopted child to be placed in a heterosexual family environment is of paramount importance and , therefore , that adoptions by homosexual couples should not be considered desirable and should not be allowed by law in the eu ?
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( de ) mr president , 30 years ago during the autumn of 1979 , this house  |||  adopted  |||  the first urgent resolution in relation to afghanistan , the author of which was otto von habsburg , whom i worked with at that time .
( de ) madam president , i am  |||  always  |||  pleased when new members join the european union , which is why i also voted in favour of this motion .
finally , i would ask the commissioner or the commission to present to us a detailed  |||  analysis  |||  of the impact of acta on the european union .
a positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad : sexual violence , stalking and ,  |||  above  |||  all , exploitation of minors , which i consider to be very , very important .
i should take this opportunity to remind you once  |||  again  |||  that smes are the most authentic representatives of the european economic fabric and provide numerous examples of excellence that should be encouraged and supported .
i think this is a good report that must be  |||  adopted  |||  .
i end by echoing what was said about ambassador richard holbrooke , and the fact that his final words as he went into his last surgery were on  |||  afghanistan  |||  .
on the structural funds and what we are already doing : in negotiations with parliament in agreeing the 2009 budget , we already  |||  agreed  |||  and have made a declaration that we will accelerate the absorption and we will make the decision - making process more flexible for member states , including on how to use structural funds .
several different teams of researchers need to see them " work " again and  |||  again  |||  using common rules .
yet return they did , though not intentionally , when statist and corporatist changes in the institutions of the economy curbed innovation and ambition , with the result that the workplace in europe became once  |||  again  |||  as stultifying as it had been in the past .
i should like to express my satisfaction that mrs grabowska 's report is being put to the vote today , first and foremost because we have been waiting for the revised version of the regulation in question for a long time , and secondly , because this vote should enable the text to be  |||  adopted  |||  while the french presidency - a presidency that has spared no effort to bring the text to a successful conclusion - is still in office .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur when he highlights the need for the light commercial vehicle sector to follow the example of the car sector , which is trying to reduce co2 emissions .
the  |||  agreement  |||  must be strong enough to combat the challenge of climate change and , at the same time , it must be balanced and fair with regard to developing countries .
it is a great mistake and it is dangerous to confuse peaceful protests and criminal  |||  acts  |||  such as those committed in athens .
eur 23 billion for five years and 78 countries is not enough for everything , therefore according to what was  |||  agreed  |||  in the paris declaration of 2005 , bilateral agreements always have to be reached on projects , plans and strategies to be followed , and i stress ' bilateral agreements ' .
i am voting for this proposal for a regulation because the proposed amendments tabled by the commission have been taken into  |||  account  |||  , along with other contributions that significantly improve the previous regulation , particularly in terms of financing for investment - which is crucial in order for us to have accurate and up - to - date scientific data that enable us , fundamentally , to take the measures required by each situation - and of increased cofinancing rates .
in point of fact , this measure is yet  |||  another  |||  negation of the sovereign right of states to decide who may or may not , under which conditions and for how long , enter their territory .
this resolution has many points with which i agree of course , and i must say that many of them relate to my personal political  |||  activity  |||  , especially when it comes to access to the world of work and protecting women from all forms of violence .
i say it because , to build a consensus in europe , everyone needs to be sure that they are valued , not according to their defence of national interests , but  |||  according  |||  to the european interest .
these include further endeavours in the fields of public  |||  administration  |||  and the rule of law , justice reform , the fight against corruption and organised crime , and cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
the ep report on building a climate change alliance between the eu and developing countries is open interventionism in the internal affairs of these countries with regard to the organisation of their economy , society and administrative mechanisms , and offers scant financial reward to the plutocracy of these countries or threatens military intervention under its preventive policy to  |||  address  |||  security threats and climate - related conflicts , thereby endorsing the solana report on these topics .
yet the smes continue to have too little  |||  access  |||  to loans and funding programmes .
i cannot  |||  agree  |||  to the inclusion in this process of the french and german languages to the detriment of more widely spoken languages such as portuguese or spanish ( as if languages with different statuses existed in the eu , an idea that i reject ) .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the van dalen report on maritime transport strategy up to 2018 ,  |||  although  |||  our amendment on including maritime transport in the ets was rejected by large majority ( roll - call vote ) .
the training of judges and administrative officials should be intensified in order to favour the strengthening of the  |||  afghan  |||  institutions , reduce corruption and build the conditions to return afghanistan to the afghans .
it is a mistake to conflate technocratic elites ( those with phds or other  |||  advanced  |||  economics degrees ) with other kinds of elites ( those with money or power , especially if they inherited one or the other ) .
i have not yet been to haiti , but my feeling is that cancelling or postponing the elections might  |||  actually  |||  destabilise a very difficult situation .
by means of a precise description of tasks , banks can once  |||  again  |||  become servants of the real economy , where the european central bank can act as a guard dog .
whether ukrainian society will  |||  accept  |||  this transformation in the longer term is an open question .
if nato members ,  |||  afghanistan  |||  's government and citizens , and , by many accounts , the insurgents , can all agree that there is no military solution to ending the conflict , it is high time to consider and support a comprehensive political process .
it is therefore high time that we put this matter on the  |||  agenda  |||  .
therefore , in our proposal for a regulation , we  |||  allowed  |||  the member states to grant additional operating aid , but on this occasion , for the specific purpose of facilitating the gradual closure of uncompetitive mines .
in recent weeks , china announced a 12.6 % increase in its defense spending ;  |||  america  |||  's cia director , porter goss , testified about a worsening military balance in the taiwan strait ; and president george w. bush pleaded with europeans not to lift their embargo on arms sales to china .
before any financing is granted it needs to be established who is responsible and how much money will  |||  actually  |||  be needed .
for this reason , i fully support an approach which consistently takes  |||  account  |||  of the various legal approaches and constitutional traditions based on the specific conditions of individual states , particularly in areas relating to the fundamental values of a given society , such as the values embodied in family law legislation .
|||  american  |||  participation in resolving the cyprus conflict would ensure that the relationship remains on a sound footing .
we have  |||  always  |||  argued for the removal of trade barriers to promote a more efficient and competitive agricultural sector , to deliver a better deal for the consumer , and to present market access opportunities for less economically developed countries .
president - in - office of the council . - ( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , today i will complete my speech here in czech . i will try to summarise and at the same time to  |||  answer  |||  some of the questions that have been raised here .
the most immediate and most obvious is that it is difficult to hold out long against the us , especially when the  |||  american  |||  government is under pressure from major domestic interest groups whose strong lobbying power might be used to lead a push for new trade protectionism .
madam president , i welcome the agreement on the telecoms package because this agreement brings in its wake  |||  another  |||  agreement on a less discussed issue : the repeal of the gsm directive .
to their arab spectators , grandstanding is  |||  almost  |||  as good a proof of leadership as actually doing something .
it is  |||  always  |||  less expensive than buying another navigation system !
however , there is uncertainty about how large these sums  |||  actually  |||  are and how many of these products are on the european market .
- ( nl ) mr president , once again we can congratulate ourselves that an  |||  agreement  |||  has been reached after so many attempts .
all of this will be based on  |||  actual  |||  proposals from the commission .
in this latter connection , the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators , the presidency takes the view that we have succeeded in creating a truly independent  |||  agency  |||  with an effective management .
when that day arrives ,  |||  americans  |||  had better pray that their creditors will be as happy to accept dollars as they are now .
the european commission 's proposal is  |||  aimed  |||  at increasing the transparency and credibility of expenditure for eu farmers and rural areas . by the same token it is supposed to improve the way the policy is accepted and assessed by eu citizens .
the european parliament last year demanded that turkmenistan must reach five human rights benchmarks before it would give its assent to this  |||  agreement  |||  .
once again , this aid will be spread  |||  across  |||  budgetary lines initially allocated to other european programmes , as the globalisation adjustment fund does not have any funds of its own within the current financial framework .
|||  although  |||  there are no foregone conclusions as to when the economic crisis will abate , the targets set by the member states for 2020 in the research sector will not be achieved as things currently stand , just as the targets set in the previous european strategy , the lisbon strategy , were not achieved .
at the risk of getting off the subject a little , since this council decision basically aims only to make recommendations to the member states on the basis of article 128 of the treaty establishing the european community , i am disappointed that ,  |||  although  |||  it was its duty in application of article 138 of this treaty , the committee does not push forward the social partners and affirm that the time has come to create european employment legislation with the support of these social partners based on the procedure laid down in article 139 of the ec treaty .
the ecological disasters that today 's economic  |||  activity  |||  has already produced and the catastrophic potential of those to come have at last brought home the fact that energy policy and environmental protection cannot be separated .
moreover , until this afternoon there was consensus on that  |||  among  |||  all the groups .
it includes a call for an  |||  annual  |||  european council session on security and defense , as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of eu foreign relations .
these have culminated in a strong and balanced  |||  agreement  |||  which will benefit the automotive industry and consumers and will , in particular , protect the environment .
de - politicization of surveillance is best  |||  achieved  |||  by creating an independent body , whether formal or informal , while stricter and more binding rules must include a stronger link between deficit and debt criteria .
global  |||  agreement  |||  would be the best way to introduce such a tax , but the uk 's stamp duty on shares demonstrates it is possible to introduce a successful , well - designed financial transaction tax ( ftt ) without undermining competitiveness .
the european union 's investment in rebuilding  |||  afghanistan  |||  is significant , but there is still much more to do .
it is an indictment of our own societies that we had to rely on  |||  america  |||  to do the job for us .
those of us who support direct democracy in a localism  |||  agenda  |||  would say , ' why stop at energy ? '
( ro ) acts of violence or terrorism are  |||  almost  |||  an everyday occurrence in the republics in the north caucasus .
we also consider the passage on  |||  access  |||  to redress important .
educational opportunities have multiplied , air and water pollution have plummeted , and life expectancy has increased almost to west european levels  |||  across  |||  the region .
it is a failure of our africa diplomacy that any  |||  african  |||  government still has any regard for mugabe .
member of the commission . - ( fr ) honourable members , friends ,  |||  allow  |||  me first of all to thank in particular the rapporteurs , mrs koppa and mr salafranca sánchez - neyra , for their excellent reports on , respectively , the strategic partnership between the european union and brazil , and between the european union and mexico .
finally , i am satisfied that the committee on industry , research and energy has accepted an  |||  amendment  |||  to the legislative resolution calling on the european commission to consult the group of experts , in accordance with article 31 of the treaty .
the core element of the above  |||  action  |||  plan was the conclusion of voluntary partnership agreements with third - country timber producers .
it is a weakness that ( unlike in  |||  america  |||  ) also carries a broad consensus : most agree that it needs to be addressed , and that government has the obligation to do so .
( lt ) as road transport emits  |||  almost  |||  25 % of all co2 , the eu 's greatest task is to reduce the intensity of energy use by the means of transport and the amount of carbon compounds which these emit into the atmosphere .
i must mention that not a single  |||  amendment  |||  was tabled and i would like , at the same time , to congratulate mrs paliadeli for this result .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur , mrs weisgerber , who favours the general objective of better regulation .
finally , i should like to thank commissioner almunia once again for his availability ,  |||  although  |||  i still think we need to have a clarifying debate with the commissioner responsible in accordance with the specific and technical nature of the subject , and the commission 's obligation to propose a specific initiative .
the other difficulty with that fashionable hypothesis is that most of the  |||  alleged  |||  costs are illusory or trumped up .
the objective of this policy is not to target tax havens per se but to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  with as many third countries as possible on the common principles of cooperation and transparency .
the diseases that we are discussing today - alzheimer 's disease ,  |||  although  |||  parkinson 's disease is also referred to in the text - are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for europe .
we must , however , provide more funds to ensure that our young people are able to  |||  access  |||  , partake of and utilise this opportunity to the full , because this is one of those rare occasions when we can offer something .
it would also be possible , however , to regard the  |||  afghan  |||  and iranian cases as a single issue of ' individuals facing the threat of death ' .
everyone knows that it cannot be " won , " whatever that means , and brown knows that both the war and britain 's servile subordination to the bush  |||  administration  |||  are deeply unpopular in britain .
under the german presidency of the council , on 20/21 june 2007 the european council  |||  adopted  |||  a common strategy for central asia .
the european union has  |||  always  |||  been concerned with the free movement of people and goods .
i voted against the european parliament resolution on the negotiations for the free trade  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu and india .
we demand just one thing : that the parties in the crisis  |||  allow  |||  us to help and that they should help themselves in particular , because this is a human crisis on a huge scale .
finally , our communication also suggests the creation at the beginning of 2009 of a european coordination structure to support ccs demonstration projects through knowledge - sharing , joint communication  |||  activities  |||  and other joint actions .
|||  another  |||  problem is the pressure of mass distribution with falling prices , which means that increases in production costs cannot be regained from the sale price .

i voted in favour of the alvaro report on the  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu and the usa on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of combating terrorism , because i feel that this agreement now strikes a balance between the objectives of security in the fight against terrorism and the objectives of freedom in the protection of citizens ' privacy .

it is those countries that have contributed least to climate change that will be  |||  affected  |||  most by it and if we do not resolve the issue of financing , we will not get a climate agreement either .
the number of infections could obviously be reduced considerably ; first of all , greater discipline is needed in hospitals because , on the one hand , there are people who visit patients in hospital and there is  |||  always  |||  the risk of transferring bacteria and , on the other hand , hygiene rules need to be applied strictly by both patients and staff and staff need constant information and training on healthcare - associated infections .

however , i also think that , considering we had major problems getting the eu to speak with one voice at cop 15 in copenhagen last year , it provides food for thought that we are so divided in parliament , as was evident in the votes both on the  |||  amendments  |||  and on the overall resolution .

i  |||  agree  |||  with the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs that it is of the utmost importance for parliament to be able to fully and timely exercise its prerogatives and for the commission to actively inform parliament about all draft measures , amended draft measures and final draft measures that it intends to adopt under article 291 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union , which provides that , where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding union acts are needed and implementing powers are conferred on the commission , the control on the exercise of such implementing powers by the commission rests with the member states alone .

drawing attention to the influence of  |||  advertising  |||  is all well and good , but it would be better to postulate ethical - legal control based on prior acceptance of a universal value system , founded , best of all , on divine law .
i am convinced that ryanair has done more for understanding  |||  among  |||  the peoples of europe that the eu 's cultural projects together .
further , in close collaboration with the relevant customs authorities , we intend to take forward measures under the new instrument for stability to combat illegal trafficking in arms by air , targeting particularly  |||  aircraft  |||  travelling to and within africa .
if you push a law through the hungarian parliament and decree that , from now on , it may only be  |||  amended  |||  with a two - thirds majority , you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election .
the eu can , and must , use numerous tools to deter such  |||  actions  |||  , such as asset freezes , travel bans , etc.
mr president , i just wanted to say that i was very sorry that we have decided  |||  again  |||  not to receive travel expenses .
in writing . - ( pl ) the rising power that is china is having an enormous impact on the process of sustainable development in africa , but we must bear in mind that  |||  african  |||  states are responsible for the overall impact of the presence of foreigners and foreign organisations or governments on their territory .
the germans themselves  |||  agree  |||  with this view , as the white paper on security in germany clearly shows .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur in urging the edps to include in its next activity report ( for the 2009 financial year ) a chapter giving a detailed account of the follow - up during the year to parliament 's earlier discharge decisions .
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , in this situation , where , after a struggle that has gone on for months , the way is finally open to a solution in which , of the in excess of 50 000 directly - affected jobs , probably - at least  |||  according  |||  to what the new investors are telling us - around 40 000 can be saved , not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses , it is now time to address the workforce of general motors in europe .
i therefore think it is advisable that you should give the names soon , so that public opinion , and competition  |||  among  |||  companies , large or small , can be allowed to cool down .
therefore , i would ask you to support the  |||  amendments  |||  put forward by the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) on this subject .
although the amendment has not yet been voted by the senate , this casts a shadow over negotiations towards a second stage  |||  agreement  |||  , due to commence in the spring .
on the subject of management of migration , you have once  |||  again  |||  made significant promises .
there is also a rationale for such measures applying to the provision of health services , especially when new communication technologies  |||  allow  |||  controversial practices such as e-doctor consultations .
it is so embarrassing that the already weak socio - political goals that mr barroso put forward have been watered down once  |||  again  |||  by germany , by chancellor merkel .
the buyers of the cdos were often misguided by rating  |||  agencies  |||  that performed badly and did not provide reliable information .
the imf continues to insist on an  |||  alternative  |||  economic " theory " ( though using that term may suggest a higher level of analysis than is merited ) -- one which keynes fought against over sixty years ago .
we hope that we - parliament and you in the commission - can work on this together so that citizens do not feel that the social successes we have achieved with some difficulty are being undone  |||  again  |||  by bogus quantitative competition .
the rapporteur has confirmed that the  |||  agency  |||  is , in fact , part of euratom and has no budget of its own , which is cause for reflection about the usefulness of it remaining organised as it is .
|||  although  |||  not all of the conclusions in this report are unjustifiable , voting against these resolutions , which approved the approach and the conclusions of a text that i believe has been managed in a biased fashion but , above all , on the basis of incomplete objectives , struck me as being the most honest intellectual solution .
too many people have died in europe as a result of  |||  acts  |||  of terrorism to allow a situation of this type .
the european union agency for fundamental rights has , of course , some objectives to fulfil but , if parliament or the commission ask the  |||  agency  |||  to accomplish a certain task , the agency will certainly do that .
now let us not forget that the current topic is the conclusion and strengthening of the geneva agreement on trade in bananas , and the european parliament and the council will still have the opportunity to discuss whether they intend to support  |||  additional  |||  free trade conventions with andean countries and central america later , when , of course , the commission submits its relevant proposal .
i am very grateful and i hope that you will also  |||  address  |||  the matter of the threat posed by , or the opportunities related to , internet trade .
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - ( es ) mr president , i would also like to begin by thanking mrs pack and congratulating her on her report - because of her willing attitude most of the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled by our group were also incorporated into it .
under the influence of the information revolution and globalization , world politics is changing in a way that prevents  |||  america  |||  from achieving all its international goals acting alone .
madam president , i also wanted to speak on energy efficiency but apparently the rule is that , if there are no  |||  amendments  |||  , no oral explanation may be made , so i will put in a written one .
our research for quality online casinos to play blackjack casinos are  |||  above  |||  the absolute best three proved .
however , i would also highlight the support of the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our  |||  america  |||  in terms of financing as well as of energy , agriculture and food .
madam president , as a result of the conciliation procedure , a level of expenditure was  |||  agreed  |||  which was satisfactory for parliament and sufficient for realisation of the most important objectives of the union next year .
parliament has only one opportunity , often very brief , to look at the way the  |||  agencies  |||  operate , during the budget and budget discharge votes .
we think it is important to continue the membership negotiations with turkey and to put pressure on this country to comply with the copenhagen criteria , because that will force it to comply with the human rights requirements and  |||  adopt  |||  a more progressive attitude to minorities like the kurds , armenians , assyrians and syrians , who we believe would perhaps be the ones to benefit most from turkey joining the eu - an eu that is genuinely democratic and prepared to accept diversity .
this is an extremely important first step in strengthening eu - brazil aviation relations which has allowed brazil and the eu to move towards negotiating a comprehensive air transport  |||  agreement  |||  .
we only stayed in this hotel because it was inexpensive and close to the  |||  airport  |||  . the room was clean but the bed was horrible .
( de ) mr president , we  |||  agree  |||  with our fellow members that we should give appropriate recognition to the role of the kurdish language in turkey .
if possible , i would also add the option of access to the global adjustment fund for areas that may be  |||  affected  |||  by this agreement .
gazprom has flooded the market in turkey , withheld gas in ukraine , threatened to do so in belarus , and offered preferential market  |||  access  |||  to willing partners , such as italy .
modern bluetooth device selection widgets , including a button and chooser , have been  |||  added  |||  .
for this reason , particularly in the context of the eighth framework research programme , i would ask the commissioner to work to ensure that the research programmes in the areas of foodstuffs / feedstuffs are strengthened , so that there is an improvement in research into the safety of foodstuffs and the health of  |||  animals  |||  and humans in this area and so that we can prepare the appropriate documents here for the citizens of europe in the future .
in  |||  addition  |||  , regular consultation of the social partners and a stronger involvement of national parliaments are necessary preconditions of a credible and transparent surveillance framework .
today we are also seeing an increase in soil erosion , which could jeopardise the agricultural use of many areas of land  |||  across  |||  the european union in the decades to come .
it is important to stress that developing countries ,  |||  although  |||  they are not the source of the international crisis , are affected disproportionately by it .
|||  according  |||  to a recent large survey by the european bank of reconstruction and development , only 36 % of russians support democracy and a mere 28 % support market reform , by far the lowest among all transition countries on both counts .
nevertheless , the political debates , the conservative attacks on human rights are  |||  alarming  |||  and they clearly underline the fact that the fight for women 's rights is far from over .
for this reason , we have  |||  always  |||  emphasised the importance of a powerful supervisory committee and of a high level of independence .
the stern report which you and the greens like to quote , mrs harms , calculates that , of 13 potential co2 - reduction measures , those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are  |||  actually  |||  the least effective .
google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website , compiling reports on website  |||  activity  |||  for website operators and providing other use of the website and internet services .
on the screens , we then saw that we voted on  |||  amendment  |||  1 .
we must take action and in this regard i appreciated the serious declarations made today by commissioner potočnik , whose expertise i value and whose commitment i must  |||  acknowledge  |||  .
|||  although  |||  there are huge differences between groups and individuals that face discrimination , we need to address the problem of discrimination as a phenomenon consistently , without specifying any particular group or groups .
today , after two years of difficult negotiations with member states , the european parliament voted on adopting an  |||  agreement  |||  on a regulation which will cover all the rights of passengers using national or cross - border long - distance transport services .
i would just like to add another point on  |||  another  |||  of the reports .
the  |||  actual  |||  subject , human rights and their implementation over the last four years , is not mentioned .
how can we prevent the use of pakistan 's territory for the training of taliban fighters , who then play a significant role in the fighting in afghanistan , where european and  |||  american  |||  troops are deployed ?
there is no question that it should be made easier to  |||  access  |||  the various european parliament , council and commission documents .
i therefore now appeal directly to the commission and to my fellow members to say that the  |||  ambition  |||  shown cannot be less than the ambition to build another european centre of interest based on an integrated maritime policy .
|||  action  |||  is needed based on a renewed policy of economic , financial and social cooperation , an intelligent immigration policy , and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in tunisia .
such regulation plays a crucial role , because it replaces regulation at national level with regulation at european level , and provides for conditions for taking into  |||  account  |||  the specificities of the various funds covered , on the basis of their systemic risk .
if we cannot answer this question , google , i am  |||  afraid  |||  , will be the only player able to meet the needs of the libraries themselves .
in  |||  addition  |||  , i can see that it would be worth creating a charter of media freedoms , which would provide guarantees not just for the social rights of broadcasters and journalists , but would also guarantee freedom of expression .
i agree with the request for the commission to suspend the  |||  agreement  |||  with mercosur until a new agreement has been drafted with the countries concerned , in order to guarantee high quality , safe products for european consumers , as well as value for money on foreign markets .
in copenhagen , we must aim high so as to achieve an  |||  agreement  |||  based on scientific findings .
regarding belarus , draft negotiating directives for visa facilitation were  |||  adopted  |||  by the commission a month ago , and we will recommend multiple - entry visas with a long period of validity for bona fide travellers and set deadlines for processing visa applications , as well as possible exemptions for visa obligations for holders of diplomatic passports .
in writing . - i support this report which recognises that credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  lack accountability , competition and transparency , notably with regard to sovereign debt .
an international treaty that would adopt standards similar to those of the eu , but also to those already in place in countries like the us or japan , would still be a most valuable contribution to the current prevailing international standard as defined by the wto trips  |||  agreement  |||  .
others include the common agricultural policy health check - which would , for example , decrease consumption aid for butter - or the schemes for school milk and fruit , the community legislation on  |||  advertising  |||  and marketing to promote responsible advertising , or the directive on unfair commercial practices .
protecting species is thus quite clearly a matter that  |||  affects  |||  a number of policy areas .
no one dreamed that a line drawn on the 38th parallel for the tactical purpose of organizing the surrender of japanese units to soviet and  |||  american  |||  forces would become a scar across the korean peninsula that would create two separate states .
( nl ) mr president , special times call for special policies and , certainly , now that we are trying to haul ourselves out of the crisis , it is a good thing that space has been found on the council 's  |||  agenda  |||  for energy and innovation , specifically .
most action taken by private individuals against these specific agencies in the united states of  |||  america  |||  is unfounded , due to a 1933 law which stipulates that rating agencies are not liable for money lost as a result of erroneous ratings .
you will be aware that the globalisation adjustment fund has a maximum funding amount of eur 500 million per annum and that it is exclusively for the purpose of providing additional support for those employees  |||  affected  |||  by globalisation who have lost their jobs and have been affected by the consequences of far - reaching structural changes in world trade patterns .
i welcome the ilo initiative to  |||  adopt  |||  a convention supplemented by recommendations on decent work for domestic workers .
we are of course confident that the main guidelines that we have managed to  |||  agree  |||  with our social partners will in practice allow the necessary measures to be developed and established so that change and security can be ensured and so that europe is better able to successfully tackle the challenges facing us as a result of globalisation .
these funds would at best ameliorate -- not eliminate -- prevailing global disparities in educational  |||  access  |||  and quality .
it was rather  |||  alarming  |||  that national laws could be , as it were , censured by that court .
in writing . - ( pt ) i abstained from voting on the proposal introducing autonomous trade preferences for the republic of moldova as i believe that its current wording does not adequately  |||  address  |||  the necessary provisions for the protection of eu geographical indications ( gis ) , particularly the gi that relates to port wines .
confidence is improved if we concentrate on the implementation of what was collectively  |||  agreed  |||  and also on the effective coordination of these efforts .
in balancing whether to use multilateral or unilateral tactics , or to adhere or refuse to go along with particular multilateral initiatives , any country must consider how to explain its  |||  actions  |||  to others and what the effects will be on its soft power .
foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but uk diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher , giving competitors a 15 %  |||  advantage  |||  .
commission member . - ( ro ) the european commission 's internship program is  |||  aimed  |||  at any university graduate who has not been through such a european internship before and who is proficient in at least one of the working languages of the european commission : german , english , or french .
the question i asked myself was : ' what can the european union 's  |||  added  |||  value be ? '
a regular feature on our agenda is the doha round negotiations : we know that an  |||  agreement  |||  is always just around the corner but keeps escaping our grasp .
rapporteur . - ( de ) mr president , as the rapporteur , i agree with the proposal , as does the ppe - de group , and i would like to make it clear that we have taken note of the  |||  agreement  |||  between the social partners . however , we are using the time with a view to incorporating this into an amendment .
this makes me think that the left intended , as a bit of an excuse , to block israel 's  |||  access  |||  to the partnership programme for innovation and research .
it may well be that we say that all groups are granted a certain level , and some groups  |||  another  |||  level , and so on .
i can assure you that the commission will back up  |||  action  |||  to improve the working conditions of precarious female workers by monitoring national employment policy and by providing structural fund support in particular .
we need to ensure a supply of highly qualified and well - educated workers with the right combination of both theoretical and practical skills . we also need to tackle persisting barriers to mobility within the eu , in particular for researchers and highly skilled people and to  |||  address  |||  the issue of eu - wide recognition of engineers ' qualifications .
if too much government was the problem , it is difficult to see how we can solve that problem by  |||  additional  |||  regulation at brussels level .
it is important that it be on the agenda because we share the same objective : providing protection for victims in the best possible conditions  |||  across  |||  the borders of the eu .
women are still seriously under - represented , mr maystadt , in particular  |||  among  |||  the eib 's higher officials and directors , and make up only around 20 % of the workforce .
czechtrade is  |||  among  |||  the national european pro - export organisations which have been awarded the iso 9001:2000 international quality management certificate .
the european union is an active donor , working with non - governmental organisations and the united nations ' specialist  |||  agencies  |||  to provide funds for medical treatment , logistical support and the reconstruction of devastated areas .
i voted for this joint resolution , which allows us at one and the same time to defend the right of parents to adopt a child from  |||  another  |||  member state , and to ensure the protection of minors at the time they are adopted and after they have been adopted .
( de ) mr president , the internet platform wikileaks is publishing - to put it simply - confidential information , and , naturally , that is  |||  always  |||  very unpleasant for the parties involved .
mr president , please excuse me . i may be wrong , but i do not remember voting on the oral  |||  amendment  |||  to paragraph 68 .
a nuclear  |||  accident  |||  is not a linear event ; the consequences ripple outwards like the radioactivity which is still discharging into the sea .
because the past 65 years have shown that , when americans and europeans devote their energies to common purpose , there is  |||  almost  |||  nothing we are unable to accomplish .
however , if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all , then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected , or - if we reach an  |||  agreement  |||  - whether all of the data needs to be transmitted .
finally , the prepared  |||  alternative  |||  procedure was only used on the very last pre - registration day and only proved necessary to a limited extent as the reach it system operated adequately until the last after all .
after many years , latin america is  |||  again  |||  experiencing an institutional rupture .
this example shows very clearly that governments should not only think about how to solve economic problems exclusively in their own countries , but they should also come to an  |||  agreement  |||  about how , together , they can develop defensive mechanisms so that in future , they will be protected from similar situations .
mr de kerchove , eu counter - terrorism coordinator , whom i met several weeks ago , has also told this parliament that the  |||  activity  |||  of al-qaeda , for example , is particularly worrying .
the present text , which allows the proposal to be  |||  adopted  |||  at second reading , only puts forward various technical additions .
in this context , international  |||  action  |||  in support of the congolese is very much needed .
we found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children 's right to education was not  |||  always  |||  respected .
the essential principle is that the media should not be  |||  allowed  |||  to pander to the public 's prurience under cover of protecting the public interest .
last week in committee i  |||  accused  |||  the belgian presidency of being a ghost presidency .
i am satisfied for two reasons : the committee that i chair acted promptly , reaching a provisional  |||  agreement  |||  , and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority .
this is due to a number of fundamental reasons : it is our contention that at a time of ongoing fiscal consolidation  |||  across  |||  member states , it is totally unacceptable that the eu 's large cohesion budget should remain untouched by these efforts .
we find ourselves living through peculiar circumstances in which , unfortunately , the financial crisis is now also  |||  affecting  |||  the real economy .
it has not , however , addressed the issues raised by the european parliament at first reading , such as the greater role of the regulatory  |||  agency  |||  , protection of consumers , energy poverty etc.
otherwise , madam president , there would have been a risk of punishing them twice over , both as exploited workers , often forced to  |||  accept  |||  indecent working conditions , and as illegal immigrants who have to be repatriated , with the repatriation ban which , in many countries , means years and years .
the basic and most important issue is the provision which establishes the ' polluter pays ' principle ,  |||  according  |||  to which heavy goods vehicles which cause more pollution and are noisier than those fitted with engines which comply with the euro v or euro vi standards will be subject to tolls for using road infrastructure .
you will probably  |||  agree  |||  with me that the czech presidency displayed remarkable foresight when it placed security of energy supply as one of the cornerstones or priorities of our presidency this year .
the new strategic  |||  agenda  |||  will enable the construction of an increasingly modern and competitive europe that plays a leading role in the world .
the crisis is more than sufficient grounds for adopting a text in which the appeal to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the area of pensions shows that the eurocrats have become more reasonable  |||  again  |||  in revising a european social model that has certainly failed .
the draft directive on conditions for temporary  |||  agency  |||  workers aims to provide a minimum level of protection for temporary workers while , at the same time , supporting the temporary employment industry .
furthermore , in september 2008 -  |||  again  |||  , for the first time - a visitor 's permit was granted to the united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , who concluded , i quote , ' individuals and communities still face a number of difficulties , although the situation has much improved since 2007 ' .
in addition to the shared vision for long - term  |||  action  |||  for mitigation technology and adaptation , the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long - term climate policies will be key in future eu deliberations . in this context , i can only reiterate the climate change committee 's call on the commission and the member states ' to adopt , at bilateral level in the negotiations towards a post - 2012 agreement , a mediating role between the positions of developed countries , in order to ensure by means of a balance of interest the success of the climate negotiations involving all major greenhouse gas emitters ' .
just like france , the united kingdom cannot manage  |||  alone  |||  .
firstly - and it is true , as you said , i am addressing the council here - large - scale and long - term  |||  action  |||  to combat climate change , which means having a new , more ambitious kyoto protocol , and that is why the copenhagen summit in december is so important ; secondly , an increase in the financial aid for the commitments already made so as to attain 0.7 % of gdp by 2015 ; and , lastly , thirdly , legal protection for these new environmental refugees who are starting to flood in .
the report presents a proposal for an amendment to the rules of procedure according to which the conditions for the application of rule 51 would be verified more closely and  |||  according  |||  to more stringent criteria , including by the conference of presidents .
|||  advertising  |||  of prescription - only medicines is banned within the european union , and remains so .
and the report calls on member states to take  |||  action  |||  to ensure that work breaks for maternity , paternity and parental leave do not constitute a penalty when pension rights are being calculated .
but fatah has not accepted defeat , while hamas is convinced that elements within fatah agree with israeli and  |||  american  |||  plans to topple the hamas government .
we should accept these levels , both in the administration and in the political groups , as they are tied to the better functioning of legislative  |||  activity  |||  , making the lives of meps easier , and improvements in the new comitology , which should also be provided for in 2009 .
this attack forms part of a bundle of eu anti - labour measures , such as the general application of ' flexicurity ' , the ' readjustment ( that is , abolition ) of labour legislation , the institutionalisation of ' slavetrading ' employment  |||  agencies  |||  , the directive introducing inactive working time with a 65 - hour week and the arrangement of working time on an annual basis .
i endorse the position adopted by the rapporteur , as well as that of the council , in believing that the existence of a partnership and cooperation agreement with kazakhstan prior to the accession of romania and bulgaria makes it necessary to draw up a protocol to the partnership and cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  to allow the new member states to sign it .
how practical will a human rights clause  |||  actually  |||  be ?
i think we have  |||  achieved  |||  a satisfactory result .
conditions must be created which release the individuals involved from poverty , by promoting policies for the fair redistribution of wealth , by guaranteeing  |||  access  |||  to essential public services , and by promoting the creation of jobs with rights and pay levels that afford a decent living .
|||  although  |||  the proposal basically entails a codification of the unchanged provisions of the regulations mentioned above , i am voting in favour of this report on the proposal for a council regulation ( euratom ) because the guaranteed maintenance of high levels of protection for european citizens ' health is in danger .
there is an assumption behind them that , if economic conditions improve , then people may invest more energy in solving the other problems that they face - political , social and others ,  |||  although  |||  all of these are interwoven .
madam president , we call for the words ' or commercial ' in the second paragraph of  |||  amendment  |||  19 to be deleted in order to make the text clearer and more applicable .
|||  above  |||  all , we must reinforce our own capacities , and that means reinforcing our friends ' capacities as well .
room service ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , vip room facilities , breakfast in the room , ironing service , bridal suite , shoe shine , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
that is why it is so important for the eu to get to the heart of the emissions problem , i.e. the  |||  actual  |||  increases in emissions .
( bg ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the volcanic ash in the air  |||  above  |||  europe has held up proceedings in europe 's institutions .
fifth , the earthquake in haiti once  |||  again  |||  demonstrates - if proof were needed - the importance of implementing without delay a rapid humanitarian aid system aimed at pooling both the material and the human capabilities of all the member states of the european union .
but this case is not about oligarchs trying to interfere in politics ; it is about a group of artists and curators whose professional  |||  activities  |||  have unexpectedly turned into a political hot potato .
with regard to the ban being discussed here on fishing at a depth of more than 1 000 metres , the committee on fisheries already made it very clear in  |||  another  |||  report that was much more directly connected with vulnerable marine ecosystems than this one is , in which linking depth to sensitive ecosystems was rejected by a large majority .
- i shall make sure that your point concerning the  |||  agenda  |||  is communicated to the conference of presidents , which fixes the agenda - sometimes it makes mistakes .
while clear about the need to  |||  address  |||  the existing mdgs , the report only briefly mentions the burden of ncds .
it is not simply , i was pleased to hear , a question of rights and  |||  above  |||  all freedoms for people with disabilities ; giving millions of passengers with reduced mobility the opportunity to move around freely within the european union also means allowing these people to contribute towards the eu 's growth , since the movement of these millions of people brings welfare , develops transport companies and creates opportunities for tourism in all sorts of places .
|||  acts  |||  of this kind affect not only maritime transport , but also fishing on the high seas and maritime tourism .
this  |||  amendment  |||  does not , therefore , provide greater equality but rather greater inequality .
next , i call on the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) to have the intelligence and the credibility to withdraw its  |||  amendment  |||  that says that emerging countries must do the same thing , must make the same commitments as rich countries .
the barking dog restaurant at the affinia serves  |||  american  |||  cuisine for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the catchphrase coined by us deputy secretary of state james steinberg in relation to china , " strategic reassurance , " actually signaled  |||  america  |||  's intent to be more accommodating toward china 's ambitions .
and does the president of the european commission deem it  |||  acceptable  |||  that one country , namely switzerland , takes a unilateral decision which affects all schengen zone citizens , in particular , workers who need to enter libya in order to earn their daily living ?
|||  actually  |||  it is not uselessly .
( ro ) madam . president , the objective of the proposal for amending the regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing the european aviation safety  |||  agency  |||  is to improve civil aviation safety in europe .
in preparation for the discussions to take place 11-12 december , romania along with slovakia , hungary , bulgaria , lithuania and latvia submitted on 28 november a proposal for redistributing the income obtained from auctioning co2 emissions , based on the following formula : ( 90 - x ) % + 10 % + x % , where x is distributed to those member states which successfully  |||  achieved  |||  reductions of more than 20 % in the kyoto emissions ceiling in 2005 .
in particular , as the committee on women 's rights and gender equality , we stress in our opinion that consideration must  |||  always  |||  be given to the peculiarities of each gender , the participation of each gender , the knowledge and use of new technologies and the special protection which each gender needs separately and the protection from dangers which differ from one gender to another , from boys to girls , and which must be stated and analysed separately .
it is  |||  american  |||  pork - barrel politics - special pleading for sectoral interests - brought into the european parliament .
this would truly enable all 27 european union member states to coordinate their  |||  actions  |||  and focus their efforts on making our economic environment greater and more competitive , on increasing jobs and reducing social exclusion .
the us economy , it should be remembered , finished 2002 with an annual growth rate of 2.5 % --  |||  above  |||  the long - run trend estimated for the euro area by many experts , including the european central bank .
i greet you on behalf of a small  |||  american  |||  republic that during the second half of the 20th century was surrounded by the most appalling dictatorships , whilst never experiencing oppression itself ; which refused to be a pawn in the cold war , and has refrained from using arms to achieve peace .
the next item is the report by philippe morillon , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation concerning authorisations for fishing  |||  activities  |||  of community fishing vessels outside community waters and the access of third country vessels to community waters - c6-0236/2007 - .

the basic principle of financial markets and corporate governance regulations should be the same treatment of all actors involved in similar  |||  activities  |||  .
this means seeking to make use of the privileged relationship of the eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 as an eu intervention instrument ( taking into  |||  account  |||  the interests of the major powers and their large economic and financial groups , particularly in the energy sector ) in the countries of the community of independent states , the western balkans and the caucasus .
the objectives set out in the digital  |||  agenda  |||  , taking account of the constant downgrading in the speed and volume of data traffic , which is expected to double each year up to 2014 , should be seen as minimal or reassessed if the eu is to dethrone south korea in this area .
modernization , indeed , simply turned out to be yet  |||  another  |||  redistribution of property to those on top , particularly those who came out of the st. petersburg mayoral office and the federal security bureau ( fsb ) .
these benchmarks are : allowing the red cross to work freely in the country ; realigning the education system with international standards ; releasing all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience ; abolishing government impediments to travelling abroad ; and , lastly , allowing free access to independent ngos and  |||  allowing  |||  the un human rights bodies to examine progress across the country .
under the czech presidency we turned our backs on protectionism and we  |||  agreed  |||  on a common and coordinated approach to dealing with the effects of the crisis both in an eu context and on the international stage .
now we need to have effective implementation , and as we are voting on the budget tomorrow , i am suggesting that we prepare  |||  amendments  |||  to the budget so that ...
that is why it is now very important that , after the referendum , in which  |||  almost  |||  everyone - more than 98 % - wanted independence for south sudan , this peace process and process of independence is taken forward .
unlike mexico , which already has a deal with the eu and is the other dominant player in latin america today , chávez 's petrodollar generosity towards argentina has forced president lula of brazil to ignore mercosur issues and  |||  allowed  |||  president kirchner of argentina to further his protectionist stance .
a decisive factor in our  |||  agreement  |||  to cooperation of this kind is that the member states remain responsible for data protection and data security in these cases .
in the same way that we should not blame credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  for responding to legitimate information on the state of our banks , we should not use them as an excuse for the market 's reaction to the dire state of our public finances .
i am all for a stronger , harder push to reach global  |||  agreement  |||  on core reforms .
our sitting yesterday afternoon was marked by an extremely moving  |||  account  |||  , but the disruption to the agenda meant that the speeches on topics as important as the financial crisis were postponed by more than two hours , totally interfering with the order of speakers .
yet the idea that europe could create a single currency , whose foundations were laid especially in the bremen  |||  agreement  |||  on the monetary system in 1978 and the creation of the ecu , would have been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and the main monetary authorities outside europe .
( it ) mr president , romania and bulgaria  |||  adopted  |||  the schengen acquis when they joined the european union in 2007 , yet both countries still carry out border checks as a result of the partial application of the measures contained in the acquis .
it is also believed that around 26 % of children and young people report cases of physical violence during childhood and adolescence , which is particularly worrying if we take into  |||  account  |||  premises based on social learning ...
my guess is that much of this is the result of traditional  |||  american  |||  ebullience : the view that what goes down will sooner or later bounce back up .
" multiculturalism " has become a suspect term  |||  almost  |||  everywhere in the world nowadays , and particularly in europe .
like many corporations , china is moving most decisionmaking to the " business unit " level -- semi - autonomous , self - governing economic region - states that compete fiercely against each other for capital , technology , and human resources ( just as  |||  america  |||  's states do ) .
its provisions include the obligation to provide information about implementation measures carried out by competition protection agencies which could  |||  affect  |||  the other party 's material interests .
even so , president sarkozy has carried on regardless with his policy of mollifying russia , reopening negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  .
the same  |||  americans  |||  who cried with joy on the night of november 4 are now seized with apprehension as economic hardship becomes more real by the day , as they witness the consequences of the crisis for their neighbors , if not themselves .
considering these results , i cannot understand the desire to increase european union financial assistance for  |||  afghanistan  |||  .
it was very interesting to hear self - proclaimed  |||  advocates  |||  of nato expressing their fear for the independence of neutral ireland as part of the esdp .
after these general considerations , i would now like to  |||  answer  |||  the four more specific questions that you have asked .
it discusses funding for roma communities , a subject that my political party has always opposed , and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the european union in the direction of the western balkans ,  |||  another  |||  point with which i do not agree .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the view that the legislation must be aimed mainly at the end results and not at the information being collected . this will reliably ensure the comparability of the statistical data , which , if missing , can lower data quality .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in the case of india , i would like to state that i expressly  |||  agree  |||  with the commissioner that it is good for us to be in talks with this country regarding a trade agreement .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , business centre , babysitting / child services , laundry , dry cleaning , barber / beauty shop , breakfast in the room , ironing service , bridal suite , currency exchange , souvenirs / gift shop , shoe shine , car rental , fax / photocopying , ticket service .
germany 's federal railway  |||  administration  |||  , in particular , resisted the curtailment of its powers to the very end .
nonetheless , the educational experience of children across the eu can only be enhanced by greater european cooperation and education systems  |||  across  |||  the continent must adapt to keep up with modern challenges .
in that  |||  amendment  |||  , which is based on the european council decisions of 21 june on the mandate given to the intergovernmental conference with a view to including a paragraph on public services in the new amending treaty , we call upon the commission to clarify the position of the public services , sgis and sgeis , because we believe that those services play a very important part in a successful internal market that enjoys public support .
the  |||  americans  |||  first unilaterally suspended the gold convertibility of the dollar -- the backbone of the fixed but adjustable exchange - rate regime created by the post - wwii bretton woods conference -- and then teamed up with the europeans to force on japan a 16.9 % revaluation of the yen against the dollar .
if we want stricter rules , they need to be more intelligent , but  |||  above  |||  all we need more democratic debate and more cross - border discussions .
christians are among  |||  ancient  |||  traditional inhabitants in these countries .
as parliament 's rapporteur for the comprehensive data protection  |||  agreement  |||  planned by justice commissioner viviane reding , i will personally work with the us administration and the us congress on binding rules in this field .
|||  affects  |||  things such as thousand separator and decimal separator .
i am pleased , therefore , that  |||  amendments  |||  have now been tabled by the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats and also by the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , which i expect to steer us onto a realistic course tomorrow .
i fully support the rapporteur 's proposals that maladministration should henceforth be interpreted more widely , so that in  |||  addition  |||  to illegal administrative acts and breaches of binding norms and principles , it would include incidents where administrative institutions have been negligent , acted non - transparently or broken other principles of good administration .
in fact , this effect was noticed  |||  almost  |||  immediately after the smoking ban was introduced .
that is why , for instance , the commission has proposed an  |||  adjustment  |||  to the globalisation fund , precisely because we have recognised since the beginning the need to give concrete responses concerning these areas .
|||  america  |||  has the flexibility , capacity , and leadership to adapt to the new rules for pursuing diplomacy , but europe simply does not .
almost three quarters of electric waste in the eu is unaccounted for and only one third of electronic waste is treated  |||  according  |||  to eu legislation .
it is also a pleasure for me to announce that the council is close to reaching an agreement on the commission 's  |||  aims  |||  to reduce the costs of establishing a business .
as i have had the opportunity to say before , the ioannina issue , as i saw it in the  |||  agreement  |||  at the last council , required this clause to be mandatory by law , but not to be in the treaty .
in  |||  addition  |||  , whatever the outcome of this debate , consumers will obtain much more information after the second reading .
by this i mean that the union 's development impetus and the pursuit of its  |||  aims  |||  must be boosted , not deflected , by the admission of new member states .
at the same time , interior ministry officials have  |||  always  |||  argued that they lack even rudimentary equipment to successfully prosecute criminals in bulgaria .
today , 8 march 2010 , i solemnly request that the european union act as guarantor of the future of  |||  afghanistan  |||  's women , as the re - emergence of the most femicidal regime in history cannot be countenanced .
moreover , iran could well retaliate immediately against targets that could include saudi arabia , iraq , afghanistan , and other us interests worldwide -- as well as sites on  |||  american  |||  territory .
the eu must give the regions the opportunity to intervene with targeted subsidies  |||  aimed  |||  at repopulating areas experiencing demographic decline .
but what have you  |||  actually  |||  achieved in cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers ' money in the guise of the green climate fund , which i suggest will end up being a lucky bag for african dictators to buy themselves more mercedes benzes and private jets ?
allow me to conclude by recalling that my task is to promote good  |||  administration  |||  in eu institutions and bodies .
in writing . - i followed my group in voting in favour of this resolution , although our  |||  amendment  |||  on speeding up a review of type - approval legislation was not adopted .
mr president , as often in these debates i find that we do not get an  |||  answer  |||  to our questions .
( sk )  |||  almost  |||  85 million people in the european union face the threat of poverty , and 17 % of the eu 's 500 million inhabitants lived below the poverty line in 2008 .
|||  another  |||  point of general agreement was that for the western balkans , the european perspective is a fundamental element in their progress - as mrs giannakou and mr winkler pointed out - and this is not only in the interest of those countries but also , as mrs göncz has said , in the interest of the european union .
american and european military and civilian leaders have said repeatedly that there is no purely military solution to ending the war in  |||  afghanistan  |||  .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the efforts to rebuild the state seem , judging by the setbacks in recent months , to have reached deadlock .
( pl ) mr president , i voted against mr corbett 's report , as i believe it to be a symptom of extreme discrimination at the heart of the  |||  allegedly  |||  democratic european parliament , which is trying to use administrative methods to make it impossible to form political groups that do not think or act in the way the majority consider to be politically correct .
|||  amendment  |||  103 concerning the length of detention and conditions ;
this figure  |||  alone  |||  illustrates why the böge report we are debating today is one of the union 's basic political ventures for the next five years .
madam president ,  |||  afghanistan  |||  has no longer a great deal of choice .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to emphasise the aspect mentioned by the commissioner that ' the national authorities have learnt from this ' , because i believe that the way the austrian national government - and specifically the environment minister responsible - has proceeded with the  |||  amendment  |||  of the austrian act on environmental impact assessments is to be seen as very positive and could be used as an example , as a benchmark , for many other cases with which many people are not as familiar .
these experiments have already been conducted in several countries , particularly in latin  |||  america  |||  , where prices have grown exponentially and quality has deteriorated .
the pakistani military finds militant outfits useful tools to bleed their adversaries in india and  |||  afghanistan  |||  , and has shown little inclination to clamp down on them , despite years of assurances that action would be taken to curb their activities .
such  |||  actions  |||  are illegal in international law , and the international community and in particular the middle east quartet should do everything in their power to protect palestinians living in this area and in other parts of east jerusalem .
in  |||  addition  |||  , i wanted to bring it to parliament 's attention that this proposal for a decision on the european patent is pending a decision of the court of justice , which is expected on 8 march .
this means that the eu  |||  acquired  |||  a new agricultural population of 7 million people in addition to the 6 million it had before 2004 .
coordinated international  |||  action  |||  is required in order to improve the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed .
- before the vote on  |||  amendment  |||  62
new delhi -- the ratification by the united states congress of the historic india - us nuclear  |||  agreement  |||  marks a remarkable new development in world affairs .
there is widespread poverty  |||  affecting  |||  almost 80 % of the population , unemployment , disenchantment and illiteracy .
we can then go further by making  |||  additional  |||  progress when we carry out a general review of the accounting directives .
in  |||  addition  |||  , all the crs were controlled by airlines .
madam president , can i ask mr mauro to go into a bit more detail on the real extent of the  |||  amendment  |||  that he has just tabled , and particularly the reason why it focuses exclusively on christians ?
the proposal further focuses on the burden of proof . in this context it deals , too , with a technical procedure , which can result in denying a product  |||  access  |||  to the market in another member state , in spite of the fact that it is legally marketed in another country or in the member state of origin .
all the available external policy instruments must be used . in this connection , i would ask the commission and the member states to step up  |||  activities  |||  to verify compliance with the democracy and human rights clauses of existing and pending agreements .
|||  although  |||  , despite everything , the evaluation of the dublin system has been positive , it is also true that this system has led to additional burdens for certain member states which have limited capacity for reception and absorption while , at the same time , being subject to particular migratory pressure due to their geographical situation .
russians are well aware that americans want their help in the middle east ; on other issues , they listen to europe and  |||  america  |||  with a stance oscillating between indifference and brutality .
we have some monumental issues  |||  ahead  |||  of us .
after the 1929 stock market crash the us government suspended much anti - trust  |||  activity  |||  , allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value .
any other  |||  activities  |||  on various boards will always provoke questions and doubts .
in  |||  addition  |||  to measures in the field of taxation , it introduces a co2 emissions trading scheme which is dominated by the major economic interests and will promote financial speculation .
( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , negotiations to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  at first reading have knocked back many of the advances achieved through the work of parliament .
in addition to the current measures being initiated by the council and the commission , the parliamentary situation today allows us to react to these violent acts and to send out a strong message to the guinean government by rejecting the report on the fisheries partnership  |||  agreement  |||  with guinea , which we will vote on during the next plenary session .
incitement is a good word to define such  |||  actions  |||  , but it is not enough to write it into the framework decision .
moreover , many employers , seeking to share the pain of recession and slow down layoffs , are now asking workers to  |||  accept  |||  cuts in both hours and hourly wages .
although currently only papua new guinea and the republic of the fiji islands have signed the  |||  agreement  |||  , this is an important step towards the future economic development of this region , which is made up of 14 states and is crucial to the development of international trade .
the commission is responsible for monitoring the transposition of the legislative acts  |||  adopted  |||  by the european union and is authorised to initiate infringement proceedings .
but if the commission 's new line is  |||  adopted  |||  by the member states , at their december summit in helsinki , they will then have to deal with the fact that the eu is really engaged in a large - scale process of expansion which will include most if not all of europe ; and that , in this process , the union will inevitably be transformed by such a doubling of membership .
i think that an  |||  agreement  |||  that facilitates trade and therefore strengthens all the socio - political ties that reintegrate the region into the global context is fundamental for its future stability following the wars of past few years and recent events , as well as in commercial terms .
we are now talking about 28  |||  acts  |||  that have no use from a practical perspective but which still formally exist , and six acts that are obsolete .
there are three problems in the world at present : one is hunger and food shortages ,  |||  another  |||  is climate change , and another is drought , which is a problem that we have had for many centuries .
in a generation , in the next 20 years , we must create an alliance of civilisations between europe and latin  |||  america  |||  , and why not even integration !
i believe that the common position must be  |||  amended  |||  in this respect .
but is he aware that , in his own government , one of the first  |||  acts  |||  of the home secretary , theresa may , when coming into office was to opt into the european investigation order , which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine , because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine ?
|||  although  |||  we might encounter difficulties the end result will be a happy one .
i urge the commission to ensure the consistent implementation of the european employment strategy and lifelong learning objectives set out in the eu youth programme , the eu gender equality  |||  agreement  |||  and the eu disability action plan 2006-2007 .
on this bottom board , the degree of close civilian cooperation is also important , which is  |||  affected  |||  by a country 's attractiveness or soft power .
today 's joint motion for a resolution on the goldstone report once  |||  again  |||  gives expression to the eu 's striving for a fair assessment and review of events during the conflict in gaza .
i believe that it is vitally important for the commission to make its budget support conditional on results  |||  achieved  |||  with regard not only to the field of good governance and transparency , but also in terms of defending and upholding human rights , in particular those of the poorest and the excluded , including disabled people , minorities , women and children , and to ensure that budget support is not provided for sectors other than those specified in the mdg contract .
ladies and gentlemen , latin  |||  america  |||  is very important for the european union , which is why i am very pleased that in the next few months , perhaps largely as a result of the work done by mrs ashton and also the spanish presidency , it might be possible to conclude four major and very important agreements , with colombia , peru , mercosur and central america .
nevertheless , in 2010 , it adopted a programme for implementation of the  |||  action  |||  plan on combating drugs abuse , as well as a national programme for prevention of drugs amongst youth .
if economic activity apart from the stimulus package is continuing to decline at nearly the 6 %  |||  annual  |||  rate that was recorded in the last two quarters , the temporary boost from the stimulus package will suffice to make the overall gdp change close to zero or even positive .
these include slow but persistent private and public - sector deleveraging ; rising oil prices ; weak job creation ;  |||  another  |||  downturn in the housing market ; severe fiscal problems at the state and local level ; and an unsustainable deficit and debt burden at the federal level .
but i want in particular , if i may , to  |||  address  |||  my remarks to mr jouyet for his declaration today that president sarkozy , who comes here tomorrow , will attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
we support the position  |||  adopted  |||  by angela merkel in germany , by the british prime minister , gordon brown , by our own president , hans - gert pöttering , and by other leading public figures , who have decided to stay away from the ceremony on 8 august .
with regard to the questions that have been put to me , the first raises the matter of the structural funds in this area , and i would like to say that the conclusions that the spanish presidency intends to  |||  adopt  |||  in the council contain those ten basic principles , which include the revision or modification of the current operational programmes of the structural funds , as well as future regulations for the period beginning in 2014 .
|||  afghanistan  |||  is a multi - ethnic nation , the largest group being pashtuns , with two - fifths of the total .
i am sure we will return to this matter  |||  again  |||  .
in that spirit , we would like to express our warmest thanks to you once  |||  again  |||  for the contribution that you have made to the european year of intercultural dialogue .
social cohesion will be among the most important issues in the whole of latin america , including central  |||  america  |||  , and there this programme also has a very great importance .
a review as to whether the corresponding union law is effectively implemented by member states is inevitable in order to avoid further misleading  |||  advertising  |||  and , if necessary , a new amendment of the relevant union law should be proposed in order to solve the current problem .
|||  although  |||  we could help the countries with the greatest economic problems in the monetary union to obtain money on favourable terms , for example , by means of a union loan to several euro area states , this favourable external credit would hardly be able to alleviate the acute problems they are facing and would also do nothing about the causes of the problems .
it is crucial that this proposal be  |||  adopted  |||  without further delay , in order for countries benefitting from the gsp to continue to benefit from it , and for the economic players that will , in this way , be able to develop their trade relations with the necessary predictability and legal security .
- palm seems to be very popular  |||  among  |||  delegates : are they protected against viruses :-) ?
over recent years parliament has laid down clear conditions under which we can agree to this interim  |||  agreement  |||  , most recently in the central asia strategy report by mr özdemir .
if needed , we will enter into appropriate administrative arrangements between the services at eu and national levels and  |||  action  |||  will be financed appropriately .
the main task of the agricultural policies has therefore  |||  always  |||  been , and still is , to eliminate this instability .
we need to establish  |||  additional  |||  coordination structures with the relevant authorities at a national parliamentary and government level .
we need to ensure that situations similar to those that occurred last year do not happen  |||  again  |||  in the future .
i thank parliament very much and i shall take full  |||  account  |||  of this report and the subsequent debate .
the european union has  |||  always  |||  produced the best results by an alliance of the parliament and the commission , so i count on your support in this regard .
it will also enable the citizens concerned to carry out , from their place of habitual residence , the formalities needed to obtain attachment on wages or on a bank account , to activate the cooperation mechanisms , and to have  |||  access  |||  to information making it possible to locate debtors and to evaluate their assets .
the argument used is that the design of the product must not be altered , the best known example being that of the motor vehicle industry ,  |||  although  |||  this proposal for a directive also applies to other industries .
some measures of this type already exist in the european union , but they should be introduced elsewhere : north africa , the middle east , india , china , japan , and latin  |||  america  |||  .
that is why the partnership and cooperation agreement should not be a foregone conclusion and , as the previous speaker said , the commission and the council must make clear statements about the possible suspension of the interim  |||  agreement  |||  if parliament should so demand at some point in the future .
until recently , it was still  |||  almost  |||  impossible to talk about imbalances seriously .
i am sorry to see , however , that intractability in the council has resulted in derogations being permitted for up to 15 years with regard to implementation of the right to information , compensation in the event of delays or  |||  accidents  |||  and , indeed , provision for carrying bicycles on trains .
medical resources need improvements so that women can safely delay giving birth until a later age , but  |||  above  |||  all the issue must be on the political agenda .
america needs obama , but mccain is a reasonable  |||  alternative  |||  .
i am particularly in favour of  |||  agencies  |||  also being set up in new member states so as to bring the european union 's work closer to the people living there .
sudan , the largest country in sub - saharan africa , is a crossroads between the arab and  |||  african  |||  worlds , as well as a mosaic of many heterogeneous ethnic groups .
however , those of us from eastern europe can give our serbian friends some useful  |||  advice  |||  to prevent them from repeating our mistakes .
the lack of this type of measure sends a signal of impunity to recalcitrant debtors and makes it easier for rogue traders to evade their responsibilities , as they can simply move their assets to  |||  another  |||  jurisdiction to prevent a court judgment from actually being enforced .
how can we control the  |||  actions  |||  of mr saakashvili ?
the report got  |||  adopted  |||  in cobu without debate .
in july 2009 , when the commission presented the  |||  action  |||  plan on baltic energy market interconnection , an initiative that aims to promote the integration of the energy market and the development of energy infrastructure in the baltic region , the european council welcomed it as a major contribution to enhancing the energy security of the union , and i am reading this word for word .
|||  actually  |||  to improve the position of christians , however , it is important to understand the problem as part of a wider whole .
in my view it is dangerous to go into detail , as has been done here , and to spell out which types of discrimination should not be  |||  allowed  |||  , and how we should behave ; there should simply be no discrimination .
if we fail to adopt this resolution , i am afraid that the european parliament will send the message that it is not able to  |||  adopt  |||  an important reform and that it has to always wait for the executive institution to decide for it .
the  |||  additional  |||  capital required was eur 24 billion .
i do not think that there is an area or segment in the european union budget where european  |||  added  |||  value is bigger , with so little money .
15 years after the first regulations regarding  |||  access  |||  to road transport , the market continues to be fragmented , with 27 national versions of rules as regards the control of access to the profession and the definition of the good repute required for this access .
worse still , the  |||  agreement  |||  on which i will have to give my opinion does not respect the mandate that was set by the european council , or the european union 's strategy for the caribbean , or its strategy for the ors , all three of which explicitly mention the need for the regional integration of the ors within the cariforum and for the creation of an interregional market between these two parties , aimed at the overall development of the region .
the irony is that medvedev has  |||  almost  |||  no room for maneuver , despite holding one of the most powerful presidencies in the world .
this underscores the importance for india 's financial stability of successful management of the capital  |||  account  |||  ( monitoring inflows and outflows ) following any move toward full convertibility .
instead of encouraging solidarity  |||  among  |||  the richest countries , and increasing community budgets for actions of solidarity to ensure real social and economic cohesion , the spanish presidency turned to the international monetary fund and lent money to greece at a higher rate of interest than the european central bank levies upon private banks .
in  |||  addition  |||  to that , it was agreed to distribute between all the imf 's member countries , in proportion to their quota , special drawing rights amounting to usd 250 billion .
|||  although  |||  in general i support the idea that the transport sector must also carry its share of renewable energy , i believe that there are a couple of pitfalls that we need to be aware of .
the  |||  amendment  |||  also includes positive steps on interoperability , and supports cooperation in the areas of prevention and diagnostics .
foetal alcohol syndrome seriously harms not only the mother but  |||  above  |||  all the child , causing developmental disabilities and malformations in new - born babies .
but that did n't prevent america 's leaders from turning to the same people who helped create the mess , who did n't see the problems until they brought us to the brink of  |||  another  |||  great depression , and who have been veering from one bail - out to another , to rescue us .
should the ordering party provide no exact details , the  |||  agency  |||  reserves the right to charge a fee on a lump sum basis .
the commission therefore proposes to make the following declaration once the proposal is  |||  adopted  |||  in council .
however ,  |||  access  |||  via the internet to controlled and safe drug information is very limited for most patients .
local file inclusion is  |||  another  |||  method php applications can be hacked with .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , vip room facilities , breakfast in the room , ironing service , bridal suite , shoe shine , car rental , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
in  |||  addition  |||  , many of the bomblets or submunitions fail to implode and to explode on impact , and their lethal effects remain after conflict so furthermore cluster munitions seriously hinder international humanitarian assistance .
the rejection of my nomination was , according to many , just  |||  another  |||  political battle : you win some , you lose some , but you cannot say that you have been unfairly discriminated against simply because you lost .
|||  although  |||  the majority of the member states apply the system based on an ex - ante fund , there are still significant disparities in the level of guarantees , the size of funds and their method of financing .
for example , it could involve all the commissioners being present together to  |||  answer  |||  direct questions .
arafat 's leadership was the most protracted  |||  among  |||  his counterparts in the arab world , as he outlived three egyptian presidents ( naguib , nasser , sadat and spanned all of mubarak 's quarter of a century ) , five lebanese presidents , three iraqis , five algerians , three syrians , three saudi monarchs , and two in morocco , not to mention other world leaders , from eisenhower to bush in the us , from de gaulle to chirac in france , and from maó to three successors in china .
the  |||  advice  |||  of hervey saint - denys always remain valid .
one can bemoan this fact , but it is better to accommodate oneself to it and  |||  accept  |||  the notion that it will take decades for europe to think in the same way on most issues , not least about relations with the us .
either we take determined and united  |||  action  |||  for europe 's ecological , economic and political revival , or we risk economic stagnation and political irrelevance .
despite several cases being recorded and judicial verdicts having been reached in favour of the victims ,  |||  adequate  |||  compensations and official apologies in most cases are still pending .
i think these two aspects , in  |||  addition  |||  to mrs meissner 's excellent proposals , will play an important part in creating to the new marine awareness that europe needs .
the resources of the progress programme , which amount to eur 700 million if i am correctly informed , are used for building up study and  |||  analysis  |||  networks .
this is not being done in the general interest and is  |||  actually  |||  detrimental to the whole situation .
|||  another  |||  major issue in these negotiations is the management of radio frequencies .
moreover , i fear that this system creates conditions for  |||  actions  |||  the real beneficiaries of which will not be consumers , but the world of lawyers who profit from the rise in rates for proceedings conducted .
a start has finally now been made on taking decisions that will  |||  actually  |||  lead to us getting order back into europe 's economy .
once  |||  again  |||  , governments are using subsidies , mandates , regulation , and capital investment to pick industrial winners and losers , rather than using a broad , even - handed approach .
on the other hand , reaching  |||  agreement  |||  in copenhagen offers an opportunity to promote the future links between the eu 's system for trading emission allowances and the regional or federal trading systems in the us and other countries which operate this kind of system or similar systems .
efficient use of resources is  |||  another  |||  aspect also related to the future quality of life in the eu .
currently , an  |||  alarming  |||  number of newborns die because of infection , mothers ' failure to breastfeed during the first days , or other preventable causes .

but , no , members of the council - and this is , i might add , addressed  |||  above  |||  all to the gentlemen members , and not so much to the female members - it is a sham to let people believe that we are going to meet the current challenges solely by reducing expenditure , as that will most certainly plunge europe into recession , that will most certainly destroy the social fabric , this social cohesion that is part of the eu 's identity .
( pt ) madam president , the recent turbulence in the financial markets showed that the trend which gave rise to increased efficiency might also entail greater risks ,  |||  affecting  |||  the soundness of the financial system and the health of the real economy .

baroness ashton , you will undoubtedly receive broad support from parliament if you say to these people that ,  |||  although  |||  you respect their unilateral interests , the common european foreign policy cannot take the same direction .

the european ombudsman wants the decisions of the european union institutions to be  |||  accessible  |||  to citizens , because citizens must have an opportunity to obtain desired information , so that they can trust the institutions ' ability to defend their rights as regards discrimination , abuse of power by institutions , failure to reply promptly to enquiries and refusal of information .
although we are critical to a certain extent of some amendments , we  |||  agree  |||  that , in their present state , the statistics produced by major international organisations such as eurostat are structured by accounting instruments dating back to a time that was completely dominated by fossil fuels and designed to depict the operation of the energy sector solely from the supply point of view .
in this context i would like to draw your attention to the  |||  agreement  |||  that has been drawn up for the construction of a modern nuclear power station in ignalin , which is a joint project between poland , lithuania , estonia and latvia .

i support this resolution and think that the european union must reach an  |||  agreement  |||  on a common position in this matter .
with no restrictions provided by any technical barriers , these  |||  activities  |||  can be accessed across borders and generate profits amounting to billions of euros .
we believe that the social fund , the globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund and the european regional fund must be used in a synergic manner , with special emphasis on the main priority that is needed to link these programmes , namely job creation and expansion of employment .
i deem it imperative that the power plants entitled to free quotas be designated by the european commission  |||  according  |||  to the principle of regional balance .

the draft  |||  adopted  |||  by the committee on transport and tourism based on mr el khadraoui 's report sends out a strong message to member states because it proposes a more flexible framework that legally authorises the adoption of new instruments to combat negative effects within the transport sector and also within the parties involved in the sector .

we have heard mr orban say tonight , on behalf of commissioner mccreevy , that our amendments do not bring  |||  added  |||  value to postal users .
on the one hand , we have an entirely justified and necessary interest on the part of most persons involved in the political process , which is to inform themselves and to find out more quickly and in detail about linkages which may exist , especially in the corporate sector , and how they work , especially  |||  across  |||  borders : borders which , happily , we have already dismantled successfully between many countries throughout europe .

finally , it uses the european dimension to best effect through appropriate coordination to ensure that  |||  action  |||  in one member state has a positive knock - on in the others and sparks a positive interaction .

while consumer complaints are an important indicator of market failures , their absence does not  |||  always  |||  mean that markets are working well , since there are times when consumers tend to complain less , because of different consumer traditions or because of their perception of the likelihood that their complaint will be taken into account .
i think , therefore , commissioner , that one of the main problems that this communication raises is that , as it seeks to take  |||  action  |||  on resources , only restricting fishing activity without placing obligations on the other economic players with activities associated with the marine ecosystem , it loses , and we all lose , political legitimacy , especially as the commission directorate responsible for fisheries is also responsible for maritime affairs .
i welcome the broad support that is coalescing around these courses of  |||  action  |||  in the european parliament .
political representation in the european elections is a very important matter for countries with a large segment of population residing in  |||  another  |||  member state of the european union , such as romania .

|||  although  |||  the european union has to have relations with the russian government , we must remind that government at all times that we demand that the democratic state and the democratic ethos should always prevail , and that attempts to censor views that are not acceptable to the government , or to put politicians under unfair pressure , will not be acceptable to the european union .

in several countries there is a saying related to alcohol consumption ,  |||  according  |||  to which it should be the exclusive concern of men .
it is sometimes absolutely essential that there are actors to perform the role that norway is performing , and i believe the european union should not only develop this kind of  |||  activity  |||  , but it should also , basically , support any initiative that might encourage dialogue and help resolve the differences between the various groups currently involved in disputes in the philippines .
the eu agricultural sector has a significant  |||  added  |||  value for the european economy and plays a strategic role in tackling the economic , social and environmental challenges that the eu is facing .

but the ultimate solution ,  |||  according  |||  to bush , is the creation of fair and open political and economic systems that can eliminate anger and frustration through peaceful means .

however , i believe that in our debate , and in everything that we do with afghanistan , we have to be very careful how we approach things , because  |||  afghanistan  |||  is a country that has come through a violent , repressive religious dictatorship ; it has endured years and decades of civil war ; it is a society in which people , more than buildings , have been hurt and destroyed .

although the european commission has come up with several initiatives to put an end to this scourge affecting millions of women throughout the world , not least by drawing up a new  |||  action  |||  plan on gender equality ( 2010-2015 ) , the truth is that the eu cannot stand idly by while violations of women 's fundamental rights are going unpunished , particularly in the following areas : sexual abuse , female genital mutilation and forced marriage , human trafficking and prostitution , lack of legal protection , etc.
in  |||  addition  |||  to the energy penalty associated with capturing co2 , there is currently a substantial energy penalty associated with the mineral carbonation process itself , which will require to be addressed before commercial implementation can be envisaged .

i am delighted that the structures and the procedures have worked well - not without difficulty , but they have worked well - and it has allowed us in record time to negotiate an  |||  agreement  |||  which ensures good high - level protection of personal data , whilst maintaining a counter - terrorist programme that helps to save lives in europe and in the us and beyond .
this ranges from the amendment of the posting of workers directive to the social chapter , which in addition to the treaties , in  |||  addition  |||  to lisbon , should also clearly set out the social dimension of this europe .

i am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific  |||  actions  |||  and programmes to promote an effective european judicial culture , based on the supply of training measures , to be held under erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the joint resolution does not mention the circumstances which led to the conflict , neither does it contain any reference to the 8 000 attacks on israeli civilians organised by hamas and other armed groups .

on the one hand , there is the great potential for the european union to open up its services sector to new markets , in which it has a major comparative and competitive  |||  advantage  |||  at global level : the development of new channels for the sector , one of the main tools with which europe can face up to the challenge of globalisation .
at european level , as well as growing steadily , tourism encompasses 1.8 million businesses , the large majority of these being small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes ) , providing 9.7 million jobs , ranking as the third largest socio - economic  |||  activity  |||  in the eu , and generating more than 5 % of its gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
in addition , the free trade  |||  agreement  |||  will contribute to an increase in transparency on the question of intellectual property protection and public procurement .
this placed the european union in a very difficult situation , albeit one where we fortunately spoke with one voice ,  |||  although  |||  this voice was somewhat muted .
the conclusion of this new agreement is  |||  another  |||  step towards greater cooperation between the principality of andorra and the eu .
i think it is wrong for us in the eu to send european industry out onto the world market with leaden shoes while our  |||  american  |||  friends are in trainers in india .

( cs ) mr president , commissioner , i have been listening very carefully to this afternoon 's debate on rating agencies , and i am definitely no supporter of rating  |||  agencies  |||  , nor am i their advocate .

at the 2009 g20 leaders ' summit in pittsburgh , the countries ' leaders  |||  agreed  |||  that the emphasis in national economic recovery plans should be on the retention and creation of jobs .
this will not only allow us to hold a debate on human rights outside the european union , as is customary in this house , but it will also  |||  allow  |||  us to hold a yearly debate on fundamental rights and how they are applied by the different governments inside the european union , as well as to see whether the european institutions are doing their jobs as they should be .
the resolutions that eurolat  |||  adopted  |||  during its session in december were a valuable and stimulating contribution to the objectives of the heads of state or government from countries on both sides at the summit meeting which is to be held next month .
this is an exercise that is unmasking itself as it goes through the obvious contradictions that it contains , not least in making use of an  |||  alleged  |||  defending of human rights to promote intervention in countries where its own interests are at stake , whitewashing its allies and supporting them , particularly the united states .

it might  |||  allow  |||  you to feel the " form " of a concept with your hands .
nonetheless , both for the cites and the climate change negotiations , this did not prevent the eu from agreeing on a common line and carrying out a range of outreach  |||  activities  |||  towards its international partners .

on the other hand , the european commission should introduce a set of clear rules for providing financial support to local community projects in the vicinity of these areas , which  |||  allow  |||  controlled forms of tourism in the areas intended for conservation and generate economic benefits which can be enjoyed by the relevant local communities .
i also hope that the swedish presidency will go beyond the theoretical approaches already adopted and the organisational issues decided and start to take specific  |||  actions  |||  , thereby actually putting these frameworks into practice .
this will enable us to eliminate current discrepancies between the regulations applied by member states ,  |||  along  |||  with errors , as well as to make more efficient use of public money .
i believe that all of this requires not only  |||  actions  |||  and declarations but a solid investigation which should be carried out not only by the people on the ground but also by the international criminal court .
today i want to make use of the floor to thank the slovak citizens , who put their lives at stake when helping to bring down the iron curtain in 1989 , and those who understood the importance of the reforms , though it was not  |||  always  |||  easy . it is because of them that the slovak people can build a strong slovakia in a strong europe today .

mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is an important debate , because it concerns the future of a sector which  |||  affects  |||  almost all our citizens , if not all of them , on a daily basis and which , on top of that , employs millions of people across europe and confronts them with particularly big challenges .

it appeared finally to japan by the minister of ict to take  |||  advantage  |||  .
|||  another  |||  important issue for the eu is immigration control .

after all , not only our critics , but also the european commission itself , will have to  |||  answer  |||  to the hungarian and european civil society and journalists to say why the osce and the human rights commissioner of the council of europe have also harshly criticised the aspects i have just mentioned .
the fisheries ministers will probably pass excessive fishing quotas again , and biodiversity will once  |||  again  |||  be pushed to the sidelines .
in the light of the  |||  above  |||  , and to encourage the suggestions contained in the report , i voted in favour .
we  |||  agree  |||  that , because of the symbolic value of the award , as a factor that contributes to european unification , transnational sites need to be favoured , because they support cohesion , promote the creation of networks and encourage cooperation between member states or regions .
as an  |||  american  |||  recipient of a kidney who was once desperate enough to consider doing that myself ( fortunately , a friend ended up donating to me ) , i agree wholeheartedly that we should offer well - informed individuals a reward if they are willing to save a stranger 's life .
contrary to what most observers seem to believe , the  |||  answer  |||  does not lie in scrutinizing the federal reserve 's mandate or debating the record of developing - country policymakers .

the report  |||  advocates  |||  the wrong priorities in the struggle against terrorism .

it is important for the future 2011-2020  |||  action  |||  plan to make a significant contribution to strengthening the european union 's common policy .
|||  again  |||  in july we saw the failure of another attempt to conclude the ' doha round ' , which aims to take trade liberalisation a step forward , and parliament is already seeking to approve an own - initiative report which strives to such a sickening extent for the worldwide liberalisation of trade in services either within the wto or through bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries promoted by the eu .

i would also like to say to mrs comi that i  |||  agree  |||  with her on the link that we must establish between the single market act and mr tajani 's communication on industrial policy .
the establishment of the european external action service ( eeas ) should contribute further to the development of a truly comprehensive european approach to civilian and military crisis management , conflict prevention and peacebuilding , and provide the eu with  |||  adequate  |||  structures , staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities .
safety on the community 's railways - amendment of regulation ( ec ) no 881/2004 establishing a european railway  |||  agency  |||  ( debate )
here are judges , they will say , who do not understand that they have no legitimate qualifications to act as agents of  |||  american  |||  foreign policy , a job committed by the constitution to the president and ( they may grudgingly admit ) congress .
|||  americans  |||  think they know what it is : a central government with a large budget ( about 20 % of gdp ) , whose macroeconomic role is to carry out counter - cyclical spending and taxation , as most us states are constitutionally committed to some sort of balanced budget .
biodiversity  |||  affects  |||  the life of every one of us .

the compact builds on the 2001 bonn agreement , which laid the framework for a democratic  |||  afghanistan  |||  but left much to be done to overcome that war - torn country 's tragic legacy .
thus , europol is an  |||  agency  |||  which is not necessary since other organisations already exist to fulfil this function at a global level .
i also call on all my fellow members to support the estrela report in its entirety . as for those who cite the economic crisis as an argument for denying women a more  |||  acceptable  |||  length of maternity leave and , even more so , adequate pay , and men paternity leave , i ask them straight : why do you always go back on the social acquis when there is an economic crisis ?

they were not tackled and no  |||  agreement  |||  could be reached during the council meeting on 6 june 2008 .
it may also be due to the fact that there are more resources and expertise available in  |||  another  |||  member state , such as for certain highly specialised treatments .

the agreement will pave the way for ' a comprehensive air services  |||  agreement  |||  with brazil based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence ' .

whenever he intervenes i  |||  always  |||  feel reinforced in my personal commitment and conviction concerning free trade .
i have moved and i need to transfer my  |||  account  |||  to another branch .
that will be a task for the future , for which a solution can only be found by putting the long - term focus on the goal of the internal market , putting an end to the fragmentation into individual directorates general and different political approaches , and  |||  actually  |||  seeing the internal market as the grand aim of the european project that we have rather neglected in recent years .
inevitably , we will need to overcome some resistance by member states to agree common  |||  action  |||  , yet the consensus we reached during the last informal ecofin meeting in nice should be deepened and developed .

it has offered us a mirror - which , i think , was very much needed - for asking important questions , such as how ready we are to complement the aspirations of emerging democracies , how far we are ready to go to deal with the situations like the one we face in libya , and how long we should make compromises here and there and associate stability with autocracy , accepting that we have not  |||  always  |||  had the values in the same place as our interests .
meps have regularly expressed their many concerns about the negotiation of this international agreement and before the agreement was definitively ratified by the member states and the european union , it was important to raise a number of problems , particularly those relating to access to medicines , the responsibility of internet  |||  access  |||  providers , and searches of travellers ' personal luggage at borders .

i am especially pleased about the inclusion of the best available techniques principle ,  |||  although  |||  the european safety networks , the minimum requirements , are only at the needs assessment stage , particularly with respect to exemptions .
of course , given that the increase in emerging economies ' labor costs and the decline in  |||  american  |||  energy prices are recent developments , import shares could begin to decline in a few years .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( es ) madam president , once again , following the debate and the resolution that we  |||  adopted  |||  in december , we are discussing the situation in pakistan in parliament .

i believe that these proposals , as detailed as they sometimes are , are based on a flawed philosophy , that is , on the assumption that the recession is over , that a recovery is taking place and that we do not need  |||  additional  |||  community policies in order to come out of the crisis .
although some of this may sound like the normal hot air of goodwill found at the end of all summits , the very public commitments of the two leaders will provide real impetus to move  |||  ahead  |||  .
i  |||  agree  |||  that when developing future eu investment policy , investor protection must remain the first priority of investment agreements .
|||  along  |||  with mr szájer , i am inclined to recognise the principles and guidelines provided by the conference of presidents .
the vice - president / high representative ( vp / hr ) should be authorised to draft guidelines for regular consultations between the ambassadors of the member states and the eu ambassadors , especially between those working at a multilateral level in places like geneva and new york , so that the eu can successfully pursue its un  |||  agenda  |||  and meet the expectations of un members regarding its ability to act .
nevertheless , it is vital that there are  |||  adequate  |||  controls to prevent legitimate firearms crossing over into the field of criminality .
it is now a fait accompli : the international tropical timber  |||  agreement  |||  , negotiated by the commission within unctad ( the united nations conference on trade and development ) in 2006 embodies the new concerns for sustainable and legal exploitation of forest areas .
the  |||  adopted  |||  resolution contains positive measures that are necessary in the current context of the severe crisis affecting the sector .
mr president , this directive is very welcome because it puts legal flesh on previous proposals in the 2006 directive and in the commission 's  |||  action  |||  plan on energy efficiency .
finally , the main one , the asterisk  |||  amendment  |||  demands that galileo and the eit are funded beyond the ceilings of the financial perspective .
i am opposed to capital punishment , though i know that in this chamber there are people who support it ,  |||  although  |||  they do not say so publically .
indeed , we were both in agreement that the world 's most advanced legislation on chemicals which we adopted in the reach regulation must not lead to such a sharp increase in the number of  |||  animals  |||  used for experimental purposes .
i am  |||  afraid  |||  that i am very disappointed in the way that you have conducted this particular meeting .
however , i am absolutely opposed to the creation of supranational authorities - such as europol is intended to be - which , as one of my colleagues said of the fundamental rights  |||  agency  |||  , is one of the attributes of statehood that the european union is claiming .
despite a huge twenty - first century boom in cropland prices in the us that parallels the housing boom of the 2000 's , the average price of a hectare of cropland was still only $ 6,800 in 2008 ,  |||  according  |||  to the us department of agriculture , and one could build 10-20 single - family houses surrounded by comfortable - sized lots on this land , or one could build an apartment building housing 300 people .
this is because the current rules  |||  allow  |||  the possibility for abuse , namely , to mark as honey of european origin honey which contains only a very minimal amount of european honey , and , in fact , contains mostly honey imported from a third country , which may even be of poorer quality .
but , although  |||  america  |||  has been far from perfect over the last six decades , the end of thepax americanahas the potential to create a dangerous void in international affairs .
leaving aside credible questions about the capacity of the  |||  afghan  |||  security forces , transferring security responsibility to the afghan state does not address broader afghan grievances about bad governance or the abuse of power -- both key drivers of the conflict .
as indicated by the sixth community environment  |||  action  |||  programme , the european union has recognised the need for a more consistent reduction in the impact which pesticides have on both the environment and people 's health .
member companies of komerční banka group provide  |||  additional  |||  specialised financial services - such as pension fund and building society schemes , factoring , consumer lending and insurance - accessible through kb 's branch network , its direct banking channels , and the subsidiaries ' own sales networks .
whilst the people at home are uncertain about their jobs and incomes , and are waiting for inspiring politicians to economise where possible and invest where absolutely necessary , the commission and parliament have  |||  actually  |||  managed almost across the board to increase expenditure on all kinds of useless and unnecessary hobbies .
|||  allow  |||  me to read out just a few pieces of data that i read in a report by the european commission and the european union agency for fundamental rights .
instead , they dumped us in  |||  afghanistan  |||  .
in order to realise this project , today , we forcefully ask once  |||  again  |||  : let us not seek revenge , but let us ensure that justice is done .
as regards  |||  amendments  |||  61 and 103 relating to article 5 , we believe that conciliation documents from the third reading should be made accessible immediately after the final conciliation meeting has ended , in contrast to the documents that are examined in the negotiations themselves .
( pl ) mr president , on 14 october , the european commission  |||  announced  |||  its annual enlargement strategy .
i also sympathise with the concerns of my fellow members on the issue of privacy , but here we must  |||  again  |||  recall that this agreement is an interim one .
( cs ) i am very sorry , mr president , i would just like it to go on record that i voted from another seat by mistake - my seat is 107 and i voted from 67 , in other words with  |||  another  |||  member 's card .
once  |||  again  |||  , my warmest thanks to the czech senate , the czech parliament and the czech government .
it is important for the european union to encourage actions in this direction , both by intensifying the dialogue with the countries of central asia and the black sea region , and by  |||  additional  |||  measures , such as stimulating the accession to the world trade organization .
the brit hotel soretel is 2 minutes from bordeaux - merignac  |||  airport  |||  and close to famous vineyards . it offers comfortable , air - conditioned guest rooms and free wi - fi .
in  |||  addition  |||  to specific mention of issues including the environment , maritime transport , research and innovation , social aspects , fisheries and energy , the commission welcomes the particular importance attributed to the regional aspect of maritime policy through the exceptional maritime dimension conferred on the eu by its vast coastline , its islands and its outermost regions , and fully concurs with the view that maritime policy should take into account the various specific features of the member states and maritime regions , including coastal regions , islands and outermost regions .
clearly , effective strategies to tackle the ncd burden require a critical examination of what people are eating and their levels of physical  |||  activity  |||  .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , i would like to say first of all that i do not think it is fair that , when i withdrew my  |||  amendment  |||  , you rejected part of my original text .
i call on you to  |||  adopt  |||  these basic principles , so that we can develop a decentralised and participatory system , in which decisions are taken at the lowest possible level , with the participation of fishermen and respect for the needs of marine ecosystems .
it goes without saying that statistics provide fundamental information and  |||  allow  |||  interesting conclusions to be drawn not only at an eu level , but also at a national and regional level .
i would therefore like to remind the commission of an additional protocol that parliament  |||  adopted  |||  on 26 january this year , in other words nearly nine months ago .
|||  almost  |||  two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world , and , while the world bank cannot solve the problem on its own , it plays a leading role .
in this case , this may mean that bulgaria has to find an  |||  alternative  |||  so that it can break its external dependence .
the commission now needs to take action to ensure that member states redouble their efforts with regard to the lisbon  |||  agenda  |||  for overhauling europe 's global competitiveness .
with regard to the position of the osce on the hungarian media legislation , in relation to our own  |||  analysis  |||  , there is a difference of legal bases , but the osce was quite clear and quite right in its conclusions .
remote visual inspection ( rvi ) allows visualization of hidden areas with limited  |||  access  |||  , such as the interior of jet engines , while high speed video makes visible processes and movements that occur too fast to be seen by the human eye , such as high speed manufacturing operations .
in terms of nuclear energy , it is  |||  acknowledged  |||  in this report that it is part of the energy mix .
although we  |||  agree  |||  with some aspects of mrs ţicău 's proposal , we are unsure about many others .
when we cease to react blindly , then we are capable of real  |||  action  |||  -- action proceeding from a balanced mind , a mind which sees and understands the truth .
what this rule change is about is : at what threshold do you set the figure to enable members to create a group and thereby  |||  access  |||  extra taxpayers ' money and extra resources to pursue political activities ?
commission 's position on the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled by the parliament :
there is much speculation about the reasoning behind the government 's decisions in may to dismiss the pro - hezbollah chief of  |||  airport  |||  security and investigate hezbollah 's private telecommunications network , which sparked the confrontations .
that being the case , we must first take  |||  account  |||  of the judgment handed down .
any measures that are taken in this area will  |||  always  |||  be limited in scope if they do not include banning the instruments that make it profitable , specifically derivatives .
as early as yesterday , a joint  |||  agreement  |||  was reached between ireland and the uk so as to curtail the disruption of air travel : a welcome development .
secondly , we have until now - although the past two years or so have been different -  |||  always  |||  assumed that there is zero tolerance for any error .
in writing . - ( ga ) i strongly support this report , which is  |||  aimed  |||  at improving irish roads .
of course , the european union should continue to take steps in favour of a strategy which will bring us to a progressive  |||  agreement  |||  to promote the reduction of climate change .
there is one thing that we should , of course , always take into account in this context , and this has been mentioned several times today , namely that ,  |||  although  |||  the prohibition of the party is totally unacceptable , it was not pronounced by the government , but by the judicial system .
is one of our  |||  aims  |||  really to become , let us say , the most dynamic , competitive and best region in the world by the year 2010 ?
sadly , he now appears poised to make another serious political miscalculation , because he is backing a radical constitutional reform  |||  aimed  |||  at creating a purely presidential system .
as i have just told you , these different language versions are still being finished , and as you know , the council can only pass that document , that  |||  agreement  |||  , to parliament , when the different language versions are available , which the commission has in hand .
just fill in your email  |||  address  |||  ( will not be made public for any reason ) in the box right under the rss button in the box where it says newsletter .
it is why we have been so engaged , for example in libya , on bringing together the regional organisations - the  |||  african  |||  union , the arab league , the un and the oic .
mr president , i appreciate what you say , but the fact that you have got twice the number of names of members who want to speak shows you how important this particular part of our job - representing our people -  |||  actually  |||  is .
the result is the march trade deficit , caused mainly by exceptionally high  |||  annual  |||  import growth ( 65 % ) coupled with relatively low export growth , which reached a nominally impressive 24 % only because of the sharp decline recorded in the base period .
it would also be disastrous to continue to ignore public opinion , which was  |||  again  |||  expressed in a poll carried out by notre europe before the lisbon summit .
hundreds and thousands of new jobs are at stake , potentially 70 000 jobs relating to offshore wind in the uk  |||  alone  |||  , but these jobs , which are so necessary for economic recovery , will only be realised if there is a clear roadmap towards a zero - carbon europe by 2050 .
mr president , just a point of order ; i know other colleagues will share my concern about ' catch the eye ' and you are all - powerful in this regard , but members who are on the agricultural committee , who have actually worked on this dossier for a long time and who were at this debate at its very inception , in my view , deserve to have their considered opinions heard , and i could not catch your eye because you would not look at me ,  |||  although  |||  i caught six other eyes around you , mr president .
therefore , we decided to drop all our  |||  amendments  |||  , in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible .
( cs ) i trust that during the upcoming lisbon summit the final  |||  agreement  |||  on the wording of the reform treaty will be reached .
there are many contradictions in their  |||  amendments  |||  .
future progress has been a central theme and i am delighted to be able to emphasise once  |||  again  |||  that support is going into innovation in the automobile industry via the european investment bank , in order to ensure that the crisis situation does not weaken the industry 's capacity for innovation .
nonetheless , the specific nature of agricultural production deserves particular attention in the context of the common agricultural policy ( cap ) , by dedicating proper risk -  |||  analysis  |||  instruments to development cooperation policy , and by backing food production to the detriment of other forms of international aid .
therefore , surely it is clear - and here is the nub of the matter - that in a market as large as the european union , which encompasses 500 million european citizens , we need more vigilance ? in particular , we need additional alerts that will trigger europe - wide  |||  action  |||  , with clear competences for the european commission and the european medicines agency .
within this framework , however , i would not leave out an  |||  analysis  |||  of the truly unique socio - economic situation in that , despite the crisis that followed the war , lebanon saw its gdp grow by 4 % in 2007 .
sound policy  |||  aimed  |||  at reviving the economy seems beyond the grasp of both candidates .
today , iran is emerging as the leading power in the gulf and washington is trying to negotiate an  |||  agreement  |||  with that country .
israel , rightly , may not be ready to exchange us support for that of any other power , but israeli leaders , having kept all their eggs in one basket for so long , will now have to factor not only  |||  american  |||  concerns and interests into their decision - making , but those of the other powers as well .
but effective or quick suppression of the organized criminals who were  |||  almost  |||  certainly behind djindjic 's murder is unlikely .
there is , however , little evidence that capital  |||  account  |||  convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country 's growth rate .
mj ray  |||  announced  |||  a draft faq covering the situation of mplayer in the debian distribution .
i  |||  agree  |||  with you that we need to be more active on the ground to do more and i absolutely agree that we need to revisit the neighbourhood policy .
finally , let me just conclude by saying that , while i know we will not sign an fta with burma , i hope that burma will not indirectly benefit from this agreement , because any expanded trade with the other asean countries leads to the potential that burma could expand its trade within the group and indirectly benefit from an eu free - trade  |||  agreement  |||  .
we  |||  agree  |||  with several aspects of this report , although the way in which it is formulated does not always focus on the most important issues .
|||  although  |||  the commission proposes restructuring the fisheries sector in line with the current macroeconomic situation , concrete measures are needed to help ensure the survival of the sector .
i believe that the ppe - de amendments are covered by the oral  |||  amendment  |||  which i made and which was approved and there is no need to vote on these amendments , which were tabled precisely in order to support the call for the right to be restricted .
i very much regret that most of the draft amendments are once  |||  again  |||  concerned only with deleting passages from the report that call for the right of women freely and independently to decide about their body and their life .
i should first of all mention that the commission 's white paper ' a strategy for europe on nutrition , overweight and obesity - related health issues ' highlighted the importance of taking proactive steps to reverse the decline in physical activity , and the actions suggested in the area of physical  |||  activity  |||  in this white paper and in the white paper on sport mutually reinforce and complement each other .
however , it is an  |||  alarming  |||  fact that , at the same time , birth rates are very low , which leads to growing share of the ageing population .
it also applies to  |||  another  |||  point that i have in mind ; although you have not mentioned it , it is one of the reasons for , or one of the causes of , the crisis : the obscene pay and bonuses , which were even higher when more risks were taken , since those taking the risks knew that everyone else would pay for them .
however , it is both sad and regrettable that the council representative has once  |||  again  |||  left the chamber , because the fact that we have made so little progress in the interinstitutional working group on agencies is primarily the fault of the council , which is holding back from working with us to introduce improvements in this area .
without this  |||  access  |||  , the goal of achieving a fully integrated and functioning eu internal energy market by 2014 will be undermined .
within the limits of the present factors , the solution to be devised would have to meet three principles : the principle of solidarity  |||  according  |||  to which the member states with the biggest population accept that they will remain underrepresented , the principle of plurality to make it possible to have representation over the full range of the principal political orientations in each country and the principle of efficiency keeping the maximum number of representatives limited to a level compatible with the role of a legislative assembly .
i do not have  |||  another  |||  country .
at the same time these strategies should take into account the need for high - quality ,  |||  accessible  |||  and reliable health care for citizens from all sections of society , irrespective of their social status , age or country of residence .
the lega nord party is , and  |||  always  |||  will be , against this kind of iniquitous choice .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs sartori , together with her shadow rapporteurs and the council and the commission for reaching an  |||  agreement  |||  on the ghs package at first reading .
climate change is progressing  |||  according  |||  to the laws of physics and chemistry , and we will take responsibility for our decisions and , furthermore , for not doing anything at all .
it is not unusual for passengers at an  |||  airport  |||  to feel they are unwelcome and a nuisance .
in this connection , it is particularly important to set up a special council to deal with impact assessment and strengthen implementation of community legislation through preventive  |||  actions  |||  undertaken by member states from the earliest stages of implementation of community legislation .
in china , which ,  |||  along  |||  with the us , confines the largest number of hens in cages , an animal welfare movement is only just beginning to emerge .
that is why i voted for the report on the european medicines  |||  agency  |||  .
mr president , as the joint ppe coordinator on the development committee , may i say that it is absolutely shocking to understand that , after we  |||  agreed  |||  to meet a commitment of 0.7 % of gnp to assist the developing world , that budget is the first budget - or is certainly in the front line - to be cut every time there is financial retrenchment in our member states .
the deduction is currently available on mortgages of up to $ 1 million , this forming a key component of  |||  america  |||  's excessive incentives to buy houses -- a policy eschewed by most other industrialized countries .
( lt )  |||  although  |||  it is disappointing , we must recognise that the six year romantic period in ukraine 's political life is over .
therefore , it is important that growth and the competitiveness of the economic and social system  |||  always  |||  remain on a human scale .
we need a balance between the economic , the competition policy and the social instruments if we are to be able to realise these goals  |||  across  |||  europe .
some of the countries that  |||  achieved  |||  the highest growth in labor productivity also lost the most competitiveness ( e.g. ireland ) .
this is all about allowing small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes )  |||  access  |||  to capital .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of europe 's response to the financial crisis , namely , the regulation of  |||  alternative  |||  investment funds , including hedge funds and private equity funds .
finally i would like to address the subject of the alde group  |||  amendments  |||  which concern online gambling .
|||  above  |||  all , i firmly supported the proposals aiming to strengthen the rights of disabled people and people with reduced mobility , to make transport accessible to such people , and also to provide them with information in accessible formats , because we have a responsibility in this area .
( pl ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to  |||  address  |||  you all and , in particular , mr potočnik , on a matter which is troubling people who are involved in speedway , a sport popular in many eu member states .
directly  |||  acceptable  |||  : amendment 107 ( text as a whole , block no 1 , compromise amendment ) .
another area where the commission has failed - and i am sorry to  |||  address  |||  these comments to you as i know you can do very little about it - is its failure to tackle the growing inequality in europe of its own accord , or to urge the national governments to act .
you may conduct research only for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of mutually  |||  agreed  |||  - upon , ad - served advertising placements purchased through google .
we all agree that the esrb and the isas will  |||  allow  |||  for a completely new and necessary approach to the management of financial risk across europe ; it is good , but it is not easy .
the charter of fundamental rights and the european code of good administrative behaviour are and must continue to be a model and a basis for the  |||  activities  |||  of the public protector of the principles of good administration such as transparency , accountability , legality and fairness on the part of the european institutions .
but let us make it clear : the mattel problem would  |||  almost  |||  certainly be with us with or without a strengthened toy safety directive .
there is also  |||  another  |||  important element : this is not confined merely to europe .
the minimum amount of each  |||  additional  |||  investment is czk 500 .
i am delighted that we understand that this conference will not produce a global agreement , and everyone in this chamber knows that without a global agreement , europe  |||  alone  |||  , even if it ambitiously increased its own plans by 100 % , would not have the slightest influence on global climate change .
actually many people would like to see the regulation that comes from this place better implemented  |||  across  |||  the whole of the european union .
the council will also be aware of sri lanka 's failed re - election bid to the un human rights council , a clear rejection by un members of a country which many consider to have abused its position on the council , not to promote human rights , but rather to protect itself from international scrutiny based on widespread and documented evidence of human rights abuses perpetrated not only by the ltte but also  |||  allegedly  |||  by the government 's own security forces .
madam president , the point i want to make concerns equal access to culture no matter what your background ; rich or poor , culture has to be  |||  accessible  |||  to all .
there is much evidence to suggest that these weapons disproportionately  |||  affect  |||  civilian populations , who must be protected above all in international law .
berkeley -- after the second 40 % decline in  |||  america  |||  's standard & poor 's composite index of common stocks in a decade , global investors are shell - shocked .
it is becoming increasingly evident that there is a lack of political will actually to  |||  address  |||  the strategy proposed by the commission .
i think that the belgian presidency was successful mainly for one reason ( look at the financial supervision , the hedge funds , the rating  |||  agencies  |||  ) : because this presidency understood that , under the new treaty , we need to be working towards ' more europe ' and because it pushed for ' more europe ' in the council .
does the commission believe that the registration process will now be adequate , and what steps will it take to make sure that the rest of this  |||  agency  |||  's processes work smoothly and effectively ?
( fi ) mr president , this is a bad  |||  agreement  |||  for small countries .
thirdly , i want to mention one aspect which anne von lanker ,  |||  among  |||  others , has raised .
i voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in europe following the nuclear accident in japan , because i do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power - a crucial one for our fellow citizens - can be resolved by this house in a few hours through  |||  amendments  |||  adopted without any real debate .
if spain is next , it simply reintroduces the peseta , and likewise portugal the escudo , and then they will be able to compete  |||  again  |||  .
i endorsed this motion for a resolution on the action to be taken in the wake of the devastating and deadly passage of storm xynthia on our territory because , beyond trying to lay blame , we must  |||  above  |||  all show european solidarity so as to support the victims of this disaster , which struck several european countries .
reports of untold  |||  acts  |||  of barbarism taking place in the region have abounded in recent years .

doing so will have no adverse  |||  affects  |||  on the commendable work that is being done for small business but will send out a strong message that we must take a stand against unproductive , unwieldy and ill - conceived proposals that will be of no benefit to the european economy .
- ( lv ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to commend the high level of  |||  activity  |||  among the citizens of kenya on election day .
the final draft  |||  agenda  |||  drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of monday , 19 april 2010 pursuant to rule 137 of the rules of procedure has been distributed .
following a report by the expert on 16 may , the commission  |||  adopted  |||  an emergency relief decision to disburse two million euros .
but , even if these shortcomings were removed , turkey should still not be  |||  admitted  |||  to the eu , because it is not a european country .
bush has tried to scare  |||  america  |||  about the magnitude of the problem , and he has tried to fool america about how privatization would solve it .
therefore this motion for a resolution -  |||  along  |||  with the hearing in the subcommittee on human rights next week - takes on an even greater significance because of the political and security situation in the area .
due to the long period involved , the ordinary legislative procedure , however , seems to be on too large a scale in this specific instance for the issues involved in transposing  |||  amendments  |||  to the provisions of article 28 , which i do not believe to be essential and which had already been discussed and agreed with the member states , in the working group , in the council , and during the session itself , before being proposed or adopted at the annual session of the gfcm .
on 22 october , the committee on constitutional affairs  |||  adopted  |||  a report expressing willingness to compromise with the council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation .
of the  |||  actions  |||  suggested in the report , i would like to emphasise the drawing up of guidelines for the implementation of early diagnostic services and the identification of tools for facilitating access to funding .
|||  according  |||  to research conducted by the british home office , america now incarcerates over one fifth of the world 's total prisoners .
( ro ) at the present juncture , which also coincides with the moment when the united nations is preparing to announce the extension of monuc 's mandate , i think we need to reflect on the international community 's  |||  actions  |||  in light of the situation on the ground in the rdc , which is , unfortunately , continuing to deteriorate .
it is very good that the administrative cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  between the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions has been adopted .
however , before finishing i would like to make a point of saying that the real future of the union depends on this revision , and i hope that the future parliament makes use of the böge report so that it is able to achieve our european  |||  ambition  |||  in the face of the national self - interests relayed daily via the prevarications of the council .
during the 2007-2013 period , the european union has  |||  allocated  |||  approximately eur 3.5 million to romania from the european social fund .
( nl ) mr president , i believe there are two schools of thought on the free trade  |||  agreement  |||  with india .
if the colleagues could agree that we take their amendment and say ' including russia ' - russia is one of the members of the continental dialogue - we could  |||  agree  |||  and we could vote for this amendment .
the committee on budgets has  |||  adopted  |||  a number of amendments which mean that we will require the commission to submit a proposal for a sound review of the content of the current long - term budget as early as possible .
we therefore see the proposal as an as yet unfinished product , but we fully  |||  agree  |||  with mr cashman that it should lead to increased transparency and that is what we have indicated in our amendments .
let me inject a bit of life into the debate by asking you this : what lessons have we  |||  actually  |||  learned today ?
this is not something that we can  |||  agree  |||  on politically ; it is something that has to be proven in court .
it is one of the elements which have led ,  |||  among  |||  other things , to the current impossibility of an accurate evaluation of the debt and loan balance of many financial institutions .
i think , however , that we should tackle this stage of the dialogue , which is absolutely fundamental , via joint  |||  action  |||  which , so far , has been practically unprecedented .
i have trouble to change the link under the creative habitat of north and south changed  |||  address  |||  : http://ideaest.com no way , change the domain name , and to move abroad in the host .
we should be evaluating which of the international atomic energy  |||  agency  |||  ( iaea ) standards are available to us and which can be incorporated into eu law in a legally binding way .
young people are increasingly recognizing the dramatic importance of modern information technology and are finding their way both to the internet and the neumarkt , germany 's bid to inspire  |||  american  |||  - style venture capitalists .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his very realistic  |||  amendments  |||  , particularly as regards the tasks of the mixed committee , the immunity of europol employees in their operational commitments , the role of parliament in appointing the director and also particularly as regards data protection .
the greens , however , did request a review of the ban on member states imposing  |||  additional  |||  requirements on service providers , but that request was rejected .
whenever i visit skopje , i  |||  always  |||  make it clear to them that they are responsible for finding a solution with greece , their neighbour .
nor are the anti - government protesters likely to find robust support from the united states ,  |||  always  |||  deeply involved in egyptian affairs , regardless of how often president barack obama and secretary of state hillary clinton emphasize america 's commitment to freedom and democracy .
for example , the european training foundation and cedefop ,  |||  although  |||  both working on vocational education and training , have different geographical scope .
our task is to  |||  acknowledge  |||  the humanity of these " other " ways while still living our own .
here , too , therefore , urgent  |||  action  |||  is needed in the form of specifying risk areas , exchanging information , conducting spot checks where the community 's external borders are crossed , etc.
in order to prevent a situation where we create just one more institution , our political will must  |||  always  |||  be paramount at the creation of a new establishment .
we are talking about  |||  almost  |||  90 million financial messages per month , a figure that equates to more than one billion financial messages per year .
however , in  |||  addition  |||  to the immediate crisis management , we need to look at how similar situations can be avoided in the future so that we never again have cases similar to the greek case now .
when hu also cancelled the traditional closed - door summer caucus of old party elders that takes place each year at the beach resort of beidaihe , hopes were raised that political reform might  |||  actually  |||  burst forth .
what works in one setting is unlikely to work in  |||  another  |||  .

our opposition to this mechanism and its implications is all the more justified because it results from the conclusion of an  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu , whose legitimacy resulting from the treaty of lisbon is questionable , and the regime of king abdullah , which continues to violently repress the emerging , peaceful youth movement demanding reforms and democratic freedoms .
the uk opt - out or failure to opt in to this instrument is bad news for many eu nationals from other member states now living in the uk , and is also bad news for many brits whose partners move to  |||  another  |||  member state .
it is rare to come  |||  across  |||  someone embodying so many qualities .
my goal was , is and will be to ensure that binding rules are  |||  adopted  |||  on textile product origins , since consumers and businesses must absolutely be protected .
|||  allow  |||  me to quote the great poet in his own language :
allow me to recall antoine de saint - exupéry , who said : ' all grown - ups were children once -  |||  although  |||  few of them remember it ' .
this introduces strict requirements with which  |||  agencies  |||  must comply in order to eliminate potential conflicts of interest and to improve the quality of rating and methodologies as well as the transparency of the ratings .
we take a different view and believe that a detailed  |||  analysis  |||  should be made of the failure to spend the full amount allocated under these budget headings , and that measures should be taken to ensure their strict implementation .
we are  |||  always  |||  speaking about connecting the eu to its citizens and the fact that the eu project cannot proceed without the involvement of eu citizens .
this implies a need also to provide , in  |||  addition  |||  to one - off aid , support for communities ' own disaster - preparedness capabilities .
the positive aspects , such as an improvement in energy security , can also be  |||  achieved  |||  by means of a privileged partnership .
|||  although  |||  , in the committee on foreign affairs , we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average , we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent , visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the treaty of lisbon .
in  |||  addition  |||  to the national automatic train protection ( atp ) systems , which have existed for years in some member states , work is proceeding apace on the introduction of ertms ( european rail traffic management system ) in europe .
as part of this  |||  activity  |||  , however , particular attention must be focused on the care given to the animals used for scientific or other experimental purposes .
the removal of this obstacle by croatia should  |||  allow  |||  chapters that have been blocked to be unblocked as of now and negotiations to resume again at normal pace , allowing for substantial progress in the remaining months of the slovenian presidency .
at the moment , another challenge needs to be included on the  |||  agenda  |||  for the debate on the development cooperation instrument , namely , the food price crisis , triggered by the drought and speculation on the global food market .
long - term economic development of the union must be supported , so we need to simplify administrative practices regarding permits for third - country nationals who wish to be  |||  admitted  |||  to the territory of a member state in order to work there , offering them a secure legal status .
|||  according  |||  chula g. king , fake sites is when internet predators disguise themselves as real businesses and stealing their online identity .
i also advocate simplifying smes '  |||  access  |||  to the structural funds , particularly as regards guarantee schemes , so as to prevent their duplication .
like the rapporteur , i regret the commission 's delay of more than two years in submitting its proposal from the date on which the amendment was  |||  adopted  |||  during one of nafo 's annual meetings in 2007 .
for example , if we agree in october at ministerial level on the content of an  |||  amendment  |||  or improvement to our code on anti - doping convention or rules within the world anti - doping agency , then this is the action against doping .
the interim  |||  agreement  |||  simply could not be worse .
this is in complete contravention of the principles of the internal market and , in  |||  addition  |||  , indirectly pollutes the environment .
if you are strangled by your mortgage month after month and , like me , you have the good fortune to suffer from it a little less thanks to this seat in parliament and the  |||  activity  |||  of your spouse who now contributes , you should blame the communists , old and new , who have decided to liberalise taxi licences and the opening hours of barbers and to sell medicine in supermarkets , but have left the banks free to decide what sacrifices to impose on your families , to mortgage your futures and your lives .
havel defied his misfortune by establishing himself during the 1960s as one of europe 's leading playwrights , only to become a pariah  |||  again  |||  after the soviet - led invasion of czechoslovakia crushed the " prague spring " reform movement in 1968 .
we need to do that because i think we all  |||  agree  |||  that we want more cross - border competition , and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers .
i should first like to express my  |||  agreement  |||  with the rapporteur on the fact that broadband access is a major challenge facing our societies , whether in terms of access to knowledge or essential services .
i want the european union to finally  |||  acknowledge  |||  that this change of policy has been a complete failure .
i fully support the report on the innovation union because i think that it will  |||  allow  |||  us to knock down the barriers preventing innovative thinking in the european union .
i also  |||  agree  |||  with the notion that marketing and advertising have a major responsibility for the increase in the number of people suffering from eating disorders and should consequently be more careful about the choice of female role models .
the outcome of the present constitutional crisis in côte d'ivoire will send a strong signal to all forces on the  |||  african  |||  continent , both those in favour of democracy and those who are against .
in this joint motion for a resolution , as in previous ones , we make a series of useful suggestions , such as the cessation of all foreign military intervention in somalia - mainly from ethiopia and eritrea - and full implementation of the arms embargo against somalia , which ,  |||  although  |||  imposed 15 years ago , is sadly still to become truly effective .
we also note the considerable progress that the internet represents for our societies , even if it brings new challenges such as guaranteeing  |||  access  |||  for all and the economic model of the cultural sector .
fiji continues , for the time being , to have access to the eu market under the market  |||  access  |||  regulation , since the council has not adopted trade sanctions .
but , with  |||  america  |||  's debt on a path to equaling its national income in a decade , and a fumbling political system that cannot seem to address the country 's fundamental challenges , are the " declinists " finally right ?
we must not put at risk what has already been  |||  achieved  |||  .
even the pentagon 's defense science board admits this , reporting that  |||  america  |||  's strategic communication " lacks presidential direction , effective interagency coordination , optimal private sector partnerships , and adequate resources . " in the final years of the clinton administration , congress mistakenly abolished the us information agency and gave its tasks to a new undersecretary for public diplomacy in the state department .
liu xiaobo is not a criminal : he is a brave and committed citizen who brings prestige  |||  across  |||  the world to china and the chinese people , and of whom the chinese people should only be proud .
in  |||  addition  |||  , we aim , with this resolution , to improve the position of agricultural producers in the food chain , so that they can get a greater share of the profits in the food industry .
finally , the rights for prms are narrowed and weakened and barrier - free  |||  access  |||  to bus services is not guaranteed .
even more so than parliament , i am keen to see small discharges criminally punished ;  |||  although  |||  they may not be very serious , they can lead , precisely because they are repeated , to real pollution of the marine environment .
|||  another  |||  very important question is the matter of energy sources and the costs which will be borne by eu member states when paying russia for them .
if they ceased to benefit from this concession , they would be forced to raise their prices , which would impact on their  |||  activity  |||  and the employment that it generates , with dire consequences for the region .
|||  action  |||  plan for energy efficiency : realising the potential ( debate )
that was what activists like kouchner called for , whether or not they  |||  admitted  |||  it even to themselves , in rwanda and kosovo .
i can assure you that the implementation of the ' think small first ' principle and the  |||  actions  |||  proposed in the small business act are a foremost priority for the commission .
in nearly ten years little of substance has been  |||  achieved  |||  on the ground .
the budgetary support to the 10th edf will compensate for the remaining eur 40 million for 2009/10-2012 at the rate of eur 10 million per year and this means that mauritania will be receiving a financial package which , when you take into  |||  account  |||  both what they are receiving by way of compensation for fishing opportunities - which have been reduced on the basis of what was actually being fished in mauritanian waters - and the increase to the budgetary support through the 10th edf ad hoc compensation within this protocol , we end up with a situation where the total package is equivalent to the fishing package that they had under the previous financial protocol .
today , as we rightly remember the diplomat mr holbrooke and what he did for peace , especially in the balkans ,  |||  allow  |||  me to quote his statement on the money spent on combating drug trafficking in afghanistan ( usd 1.61 billion ) .
bearing in mind that this is a case of the council ' consulting ' the ep , we would like to emphasise that  |||  although  |||  we have supported amendments put forward by the ep , even though they water down previously adopted positions , we believe that this proposal falls far short of what is needed in the area of ' protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters ' .
in fact , we can say that democracy in ukraine was the main winner because , when the current president stands  |||  again  |||  as a candidate and only receives 5 % of the votes , this seems to me to be a very clear sign that democracy is working .
|||  additional  |||  funds must be provided for financing climate measures .
this also includes shortening the  |||  amendment  |||  and test deadlines from three - year to one - year periods .
all the other amendments proposed i will  |||  accept  |||  .
nevertheless ,  |||  allowing  |||  the un and other organisations to arrange safe passage from the conflict zone for these civilians is essential to avoid further bloodbaths .
oriana fallaci published a long rant  |||  along  |||  this line shortly after the attacks .
these attacks are unacceptable : they are perpetrated by extremists with an  |||  agenda  |||  of intolerance which must be condemned and must be resisted .
we all know that other  |||  actions  |||  and steps will have to be taken .
of course , there are downsides to patent law expansion , prime  |||  among  |||  them the increased incidence and cost of litigation .
as such , we would be pleased if the european union could reach an  |||  agreement  |||  , and hold a common position in this debate .
mr micheletti has not complied with the  |||  agreement  |||  , and the situation is getting worse .
at the same time , please  |||  allow  |||  me to express my concern in relation to the current situation of mr yevgeny zhovtis .
i hope that the review of the sme code really is able to simplify red tape , ensure  |||  access  |||  to and recovery of credit , and facilitate internalisation .
|||  although  |||  the number of incidents in the eu involving cbrn material has so far been relatively small and have been due to industrial accidents or to the increase in , and worldwide spread of , dangerous pathogens , there remains a risk of cbrn disasters , whether accidental or intentional .
thanks to the budget cuts made by the current government , a significant number of romanian specialist doctors are emigrating , chronic patients no longer have  |||  access  |||  to healthcare services and reimbursed medication , and the equipment in hospitals is obsolete .
it is inconceivable that a police authority in europe should be able to act without its  |||  actions  |||  being subject to judicial review .
does a given instrument  |||  actually  |||  help to achieve an objective ?
we , as a group , have withdrawn our support for the  |||  amendment  |||  which we originally submitted together with you , not because we feel it is an inferior amendment , but because the socialists have found a better way of wording it , as mr evans described .
the hotel alexandra is located in a quiet environment in roztoky u prahy , 8 km from prague castle , 12 km from prague ruzyne international  |||  airport  |||  and near to main motorways and railway lines .
but eradication and alternative livelihood projects mainly  |||  affect  |||  the lowest end of the value - added chain , the farmers , with no real impact on those higher up , such as large landowners and local traffickers , not to mention the extremely powerful drug lords and the international cartels and mafias .
this will  |||  allow  |||  the eu to develop a role as a world leader , showing that it is possible to combine economic dynamism with social and environmental concerns .
if these investments reach all parts of latin  |||  america  |||  , rich and poor , the region 's prospects will brighten enormously .
any  |||  amendments  |||  which we felt unnecessarily harmed british farmers were not supported , as were any amendments that expanded eu control in this sector .
finally , i think that we all  |||  agree  |||  that we cannot talk of a better europe , of a europe which is closer to the citizens , without commensurate financing .
it is a network for information exchange , it offers support to recommendations on patient safety in various ways and it is primarily a platform for cooperation and networking  |||  among  |||  member states and international organisations in the area of patient safety .
that conciliation procedure resolved the most significant problem , which was whether or not self - employed workers should be included , and the parties  |||  agreed  |||  together , with the support of the commission , that self - employed workers would be included , in order to put an end , once and for all , to the problems of double legislation , the double standards applied to self - employed drivers and employed drivers .
by retabling our  |||  amendments  |||  aimed at a fairer application of a reduced vat rate - especially , for example , on children 's clothes in the new member states , so as to put them on the same footing as the older ones - we wanted to send a strong message to the commission and the council .
the main responsibility lies on the shoulders of local self - government representatives , who are often left  |||  alone  |||  to deal with very complex issues , related primarily to employment , as a consequence of the roma population 's low level of education .
it will be at that point , based on the results of the reviews , that the commission will present a new report identifying the different practices , flaws and issues examined at european union level in order to further improve how the european arrest warrant works ,  |||  although  |||  it seems to me that this still remains one of the main success stories as regards the principle of mutual recognition .
( el ) commissioner ,  |||  almost  |||  every civilisation in the history of europe has been based on the sea .
on behalf of the ppe group . - mr president , the first thing that should be said is that this parliament wants an  |||  agreement  |||  .
this convergence is being worked out in a discreet manner , and i would like to pay tribute to the discreet  |||  action  |||  and diplomacy of the high representative , not only outside , but also within .
i and we will be culpable on both issues if i and we fail to take  |||  action  |||  to ensure that neither happens .
that means around one and half million will have been  |||  affected  |||  since the report was completed by parliament .
( da ) madam president , a huge  |||  amount  |||  of work has gone into this regulation , both by mrs liotard and by the shadow rapporteurs .
all this will do is give the european institutions even less legitimacy in the eyes of the people if there is  |||  another  |||  disaster , especially with the knowledge that the european union is engaged in the wto general trade agreement , known as gats , whose commission on maritime transport says that the current maritime transport environmental and safety regulations are excessive and should be relaxed .
in writing . - ( pt ) i  |||  agree  |||  on the whole with this motion for a resolution , which concerns the anti - counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) , approved after long months of debate and efforts to find a compromise solution between the various political groups , which was unfortunately not achieved .
|||  although  |||  many member states will balk at agreeing to a solution that changes the eu 's internal balance of power , some concessions would be necessary to bring germany on board .
apart from the exemption which should remain regarding the approval of the financing of costs relating to duties , taxes and other charges and carried out on a case - by - case basis , the european parliament must have the right to monitor the  |||  activities  |||  carried out by the commission and the strategic documents adopted by it .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , holger krahmer and i do not always  |||  agree  |||  about environmental legislation and the degree to which it should be enforced , but on this measure , i think we have found ourselves very close despite the fact that many of the arguments he has put to his colleagues have been nationalistic .
but risks to the outlook are rising , and we need determined policy  |||  action  |||  to dampen them .
we  |||  always  |||  have to act in accordance with european values and international social and labour standards , even in third countries .
the message that is being sent by the  |||  actions  |||  of the government in pakistan at the moment is therefore extremely worrying for a state that says it is committed to democracy .
in writing . - i abstained on this report as a response to our christian democrat and conservative colleagues blocking the oral  |||  amendment  |||  that would have made it clear that a right to education extends to all migrant children whether or not their parents are in the union legally or not .

this waste can be transformed , constituting an added value for society , given that , if we can gain  |||  advantages  |||  from it , we can renew industries and use resources which otherwise would not be used .
( pl ) mr president , the  |||  annual  |||  report of the european central bank does not , it appears , speak of a certain tendency that has developed in recent years .
in writing . - ( ro ) the enthusiasm of february 2005 , when the " european environment and health  |||  action  |||  plan 2004-2010 " was approved , has been exhausted without many of the proposed actions to be achieved .
the first step has already been taken in this regard - the union has  |||  agreed  |||  binding climate targets and , with the adoption of the climate change package in december 2008 , it has got many appropriate measures for protecting the climate underway .
in  |||  addition  |||  , we call for european vessels fishing in the southern indian ocean to be protected from pirate attacks under operation atalanta in the same way as merchant vessels are .
credit rating agencies ( cras ) fulfil several useful purposes : they aggregate information on the credit quality of issuers , enabling issuers to  |||  access  |||  global and domestic markets , reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors , thus providing markets with liquidity .
where a consumer has enough information about his internal market rights but attempts to exercise them in vain in  |||  another  |||  eu member state , he can seek help from solvit .
isolationist policies , by contrast ,  |||  always  |||  lead to shortages and discontent .
in writing . - ( ro )  |||  according  |||  to the eu 2020 strategy , high - quality and environmentally sustainable production is one of the eu 's competitive advantages .
the galileo programme , which , in conjunction with the european geostationary navigation overlay service ( egnos ) ,  |||  aims  |||  to create a global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) , is in line with a strategic choice on the part of the union : it confirms its entry onto the global market , while its efforts assert itself in the global market , which is currently dominated by the united states , and is important to boosting the european economy itself .
we should set the  |||  agenda  |||  ourselves .
president - in - office of the council . - in december 2008 , the poznań conference  |||  agreed  |||  on a work programme for 2009 , which clearly identified steps towards the copenhagen climate conference to be held in december 2009 .
if the billions that go up in smoke for this on an  |||  annual  |||  basis were used for renewable energies , maybe we would not have any energy problems at all any more and we would certainly be a major step further forward in terms of co2 reduction .
one would think that  |||  america  |||  's leaders would be clambering to formulate policies aimed at returning the economy to its pre - 2008 growth path : putting people back to work , cleaning up underwater mortgages , restoring financial markets ' risk - bearing capacity , and boosting investment .
his examples include the formation of the swiss confederation ( 1291-1848 ) ; the creation of the iroquois confederation in the century or so before the first europeans arrived in  |||  america  |||  ; the establishment of the united states ( 1776-1789 ) ; the unification of italy ( 1861 ) , and of germany ( 1871 ) ; the norway - sweden rapprochement ( 1905-1935 ) ; the formation of the united arab emirates ( 1971 ) ; and the argentine - brazilian rapprochement of the 1970 's .
many of you here were perhaps expecting  |||  another  |||  tall , nordic young man to be doing this job , namely our colleague alexander stubb , but , as some of you will know , alexander is unable to be here with us today as he has been appointed finland 's new minister of foreign affairs .
thus , commissioner , i am relying on you , and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause , to change this situation in south korea so that this  |||  agreement  |||  will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner .
the free trade agreement will  |||  affect  |||  the industrial sectors of member states in different ways , and we therefore need the option of applying protective measures at the regional level in exceptional cases .
for example , improving  |||  access  |||  to banking services and mortgages for the protection of investors , consumers and financial institutions , or resolving the outstanding issues concerning the free movement of workers , such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications .
it is true that the rapporteur has done a magnificent job but i believe that we should not tackle the group of final amendments on the content of the net here , in this directive , because in short what those  |||  amendments  |||  do is allow intermediate service providers to filter and block content on the net and therefore , ultimately , consumers will lose their anonymity .
europe also urgently needs to develop an  |||  action  |||  plan for burden - sharing in order to assist the resettlement of refugees from the region and to offer support to the homeless .

although cutting the federal funds interest rate from 5.25 % in the summer of 2007 to 3 % now contributes to dollar depreciation , this has been  |||  aimed  |||  at stimulating a weakening economy .
you must be aware that , in the last 20 years , the number of  |||  animals  |||  used for scientific purposes has not increased , despite the fact that the number of scientific publications in the area of biomedical research has doubled every two years .
thirty years ago , when the first elections to the parliament were held ,  |||  almost  |||  two - thirds of the electorate voted , but over the years , participation has dropped steadily .
mr fjellner has represented all this in a very positive light and he said that we should not  |||  allow  |||  this process to drag on .
adjustment will be painful , but it is necessary , and in these hard times there is  |||  another  |||  message that is even more salient but will not be heard in these institutions .
a new president 's first task will be to return  |||  america  |||  's economic competitiveness and self - confidence .

but once  |||  again  |||  you could not accept a democratic result , oh no - the irish have to vote again !
poverty and the rigid social control of a reactionary roman catholic church made the country inhospitable to intellectual life -- to britain 's and  |||  america  |||  's great advantage , because both received many bright irish fleeing the stultifying intellectual life of their homeland .
this regulation , by introducing updates that take into  |||  account  |||  the latest changes in certain member states , holds out the possibility of guaranteeing to citizens who are travelling from one member state to another the possibility of benefiting from social insurance .
information is given on the development of policies and  |||  actions  |||  in relation to 20 different thematic issues , including not only those areas in which the eu has adopted human rights guidelines , but also other thematic issues , such as women 's rights , children 's rights , the fight against racism and the trafficking of human beings .
however , there are still some contradictions , as is the case with the actions proposed in the field of employment , where a proposal we put forward was rejected despite  |||  another  |||  having been approved that safeguards important aspects for women .
the  |||  added  |||  value of the european union must translate into a clear benefit for consumers by facilitating cross - border online transactions in particular .
this initiative should arm us with better tools for fighting possible discriminatory behaviour , which to our shame , is still a reality today , as highlighted in yesterday 's report on homophobia by the european union  |||  agency  |||  for fundamental rights .
in writing . - this is yet  |||  another  |||  example of the one - size - fits - all approach which gives the european union a bad name in our member states .
one of the items that are going to be on the  |||  agenda  |||  for the council 's forthcoming sessions is something that we are going to discuss later , in another item this afternoon , which is the special sessions on gaza and the goldstone report .
india point outs that an average american emits ten times as much as an average indian , and argues that emissions allowances should therefore be allocated  |||  according  |||  to population .
|||  another  |||  year has now passed with little progress in bridging the divide between palestinians and israelis .

the european executive 's proposals are aimed at a series of measures for accelerating priority investments at national and regional level in member states , while also simplifying  |||  access  |||  to grants and increasing the financial resources available to small and medium - sized enterprises .
mr president , freedom of use of the internet , mobile telephones and other kinds of communication technology is very valuable for  |||  adults  |||  , but may prove harmful to children , because the latter are not fully mature and lack the necessary experience .
rapporteur . - mr president , as has been discussed , my oral  |||  amendment  |||  is as follows ( paragraph 23 ) : ' proposes that the ombudsman take measures to reduce the number of complaints in such cases where no action is possible ; ' .
fellow members , there are serious reasons for you to  |||  accept  |||  this amendment during tomorrow 's vote .
lastly , i regret that this text fails to make reference to the correct implementation of directive 2004/38 / ec , which sets out stringent requirements for european citizens residing in  |||  another  |||  member state and their expulsion for public safety reasons .
yet these countries hesitate to let  |||  actual  |||  wages fall for obvious social reasons .
i am , therefore , deeply disappointed that a package of measures  |||  adopted  |||  in this area in 2004 -- aimed at simplifying and modernizing procedures -- has not been transposed within the agreed deadline by several member states .
we are considering a report from which we know that work has great value , that it must be adequately paid , and this payment has to be differentiated on the basis of criteria such as the nature of the work , the efficiency with which it is done , ability to create  |||  added  |||  value , and not on gender criteria .
|||  answer  |||  all your queries within 12 sati .
the main thing that both the council and parliament can do is to speed up the processes that are already under way and to  |||  adopt  |||  the decisions that are already prepared , of course still within this term of the european parliament .
|||  again  |||  , i think it is regrettable that no one from the council is present at this important debate .

also , a framework plan for new airport capacities in europe should be approached , at least simultaneously with or , if not , after the development of an  |||  action  |||  plan regarding the appropriate and efficient management of the existing airport capacities .

we should also take into  |||  account  |||  our trading interests and care for them in the long term by establishing their optimal period of validity and the conditions which must be fulfilled by pakistan .
both announcements also came a month ahead of an italian referendum -- the largest popular consultation on the matter ever held anywhere -- that seeks to change a law  |||  adopted  |||  last year that prohibits both in vitro fertilization and stem cell research .

madam president ,  |||  allow  |||  me to begin by saying a few words to my spanish fellow members about their reservations concerning ports of refuge .
the assembly 's decision that the environmental / fishing zone should affect the member states from 1 january of this year is contrary to the international obligation  |||  accepted  |||  by croatia and gives reason to doubt its credibility .

schengen cooperation started on 14 june 1985 , with the schengen  |||  agreement  |||  , allowing for the abolition of systematic border controls at the internal borders of the signatory states and for the creation of a common area , with free movement of persons .

lastly , on the visa fee , we have successfully insisted , as a condition for the external provider 's imposing a service fee on top of the visa fee , that visa applicants should always have the possibility of direct  |||  access  |||  to the consulate offices .

i am happy to make the reports available , but i cannot  |||  answer  |||  the question in detail right now .
i believe it is very important , particularly in the light of the lisbon  |||  agenda  |||  , that europe should not leave these new technological developments , this navigation system , to the united states or china but that our aim should be to play our own self - assured role in the world and in the global marketplace .

( es ) mr president , while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far , i have observed that unfortunately , eu  |||  action  |||  is driven by emergency situations , such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants , as is currently happening in lampedusa , where the exodus of tunisians to the italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold .
however , once  |||  again  |||  , we have limited ourselves to statements of good intentions , as though simply saying that we are the best and the strongest will make it come true .

i should also like to say to mr rasmussen that the aim as regards employment levels of course is at the heart of the french presidency 's concerns , that what he said and which has also been highlighted by other honourable members , that is to say , that we are aware that with greater coordination we will double or even more than double the  |||  added  |||  value that we can bring and that with regard to the method , in other words , the launching of specific projects , practical goals and a time frame , we are in agreement with mr rasmussen 's comments .
i can tell you that the objectives have been  |||  achieved  |||  and the priorities have been strengthened , and i believe that the presidencies following on from the french presidency will absolutely continue along these lines .

we shall , both here and in the national parliaments , be keeping an extremely close watch over the way in which the compromise  |||  adopted  |||  tomorrow is transposed into national legislation , because we know that a number of member states of the european union are , shall we say , somewhat heavy - handed when it comes to public freedoms - particularly where the internet is concerned - and i am not sure they will avoid the pitfall of diverging from the rule we will adopt tomorrow .

the european parliament also wanted to be informed about the commission 's intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new interinstitutional  |||  agreement  |||  on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and , more particularly , those policies supported by parliament during the negotiations .

as usual , however , we are witnessing the habit of blaming europe when it suits , only to ignore it irritably when brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations , which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of  |||  african  |||  dictators - some of whom are today being toppled - and continuing even today to lavish billions on the libya of mr gaddafi , or refusing eur 10 million of aid offered to the italian government by the european fund for refugees , which italy decided not to use , possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with europe 's transparent rules and not the in - house criteria of the italian civil protection agency .

the wto 's institutional structure could be improved by distinguishing between activities connected with the negotiation of new international rules and commitments or  |||  activities  |||  relating to the implementation of existing agreements .
today ,  |||  americans  |||  and europeans alike must demonstrate modesty .
i therefore call upon the european trade union confederation to reconsider their position and sit down at the negotiating table in order to examine this draft directive ,  |||  along  |||  with employers ' representatives .

i welcome the fact that the report incorporates the  |||  amendment  |||  on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem , which i co - authored .
moreover , the creation of  |||  another  |||  post at european level risks being too remote from citizens .
in view of the rising costs of health care , the member states should  |||  adopt  |||  effective measures , such as targeted information campaigns , the use of generic medicines , the use of new technologies , mutual assistance measures at local level or greater solidarity between generations and in families .

|||  across  |||  romania , fear is growing of a looming porcine genocide as the country prepares to negotiate its way into the eu .
in this respect , i am delighted that , as part of the vote on the green paper entitled ' preparing forests for climate change ' , paragraph 38 of the arsenis report has been  |||  adopted  |||  , which ' urgently calls on the commission to present a legislative proposal on forest fire prevention ' and plans , in particular , ' a 30 - year ban on building on land where there has been a forest fire ' .
we would have liked to have seen the eu leading the way and stopping all payments of export subsidies by 2013 at the latest - irrespective of the  |||  actions  |||  of the other wto trade partners .
we seek to promote the  |||  added  |||  value which can be gained from further coordination , but we do not , however , support harmonisation .
the goepel report improves it in many aspects , although it does make some  |||  amendments  |||  with which i cannot agree .
of course , progress is not  |||  always  |||  straightforward with positive developments .
should the ldp win a simple majority , the new  |||  administration  |||  would still face a hung diet , owing to the dpj 's control of the upper house .
i want to thank especially my colleague , petra kammerevert , and ,  |||  above  |||  all , doris pack , because she is the mother of this initiative .
i am therefore extremely pleased with the  |||  agreement  |||  on the interoperability directive , and the commission will do all it can to bring about a rapid agreement on the other two aspects of these measures .
some outcomes , like the marriage of bank of  |||  america  |||  and merrill lynch , are happier than others , like the bankruptcy of lehman brothers .
|||  among  |||  those non - standard measures - as we used to call them - the most prominent is the full allotment liquidity provision through our refinancing operations with euro area banks against good collateral and at the main refinancing rate prevailing at the time for several maturities extending well beyond the weekly operations .
we therefore need to support all projects which strengthen this  |||  alternative  |||  to the mainstream media world , and i am glad the czech presidency has contributed towards the successful accomplishment of the media mundus project .
|||  american  |||  households will need to learn to accumulate wealth by cutting consumption rather than speculating on real estate .

|||  although  |||  i , like the rapporteur , consider it positive that the number of financial irregularities reported to the commission by the member states fell from eur 1 024 million in 2007 to eur 783.2 million in 2008 , i believe that the goal will be to achieve a level of eur 0 million of financial irregularities per annum .
this is what  |||  al-qaeda  |||  , as well as purists in the west , ca n't understand about turks : they do not feel they have to choose between being modern and being muslim .
negotiations are taking place with serbia about a stabilisation  |||  agreement  |||  currently being drawn up .
the first dpj prime minister , yukio hatoyama , miscalculated in believing that a face - to - face meeting with the new  |||  american  |||  president to discuss long - term matters affecting east asia could settle the issue .

if this parliament were a proper parliament , it would  |||  actually  |||  select members to sit in the chair on ability and not have the usual big group stitch - ups .

the report that we have just adopted will  |||  allow  |||  the introduction of certain exemptions in the area of agriculture to help the outermost regions .

following an explosion of government programs in the 1960 's , a belief developed in the minds of key  |||  american  |||  opinion leaders and policymakers that the best government is the least government .
this information and these personal data were demanded outside the framework of the limitations laid down in the pnr  |||  agreement  |||  which , although very feeble , at least exist .
the irish government must analyse the outcome calmly , to establish exactly what happened within the treaty text that our electorate voted against , and they must provide answers  |||  acceptable  |||  not just to naysayers in ireland but also to all other member state governments and their citizens who , in my opinion , are also entitled to have their say and express their position , and we must respect that also .
but i am one of those who believe that the eu should follow a result - oriented approach in promotion of respect for human rights rather than a purely principled one and , most importantly , we have to  |||  accept  |||  that the improvements will only come step - by - step .
i believe that the negotiations conducted by the european commission , which permitted the extension of the protocol to the partnership  |||  agreement  |||  , have produced the draft of a document which is mutually advantageous in that it strengthens the level of cooperation between the eu and seychelles , and promotes a partnership in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy in seychelles and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the seychelles ' fishing zone .
madam president , are we really surprised that we did not reach  |||  agreement  |||  ?
i agree that the largescale slaughter of  |||  animals  |||  should be carried out with due regard for humanitarian standards , limiting the suffering experienced by animals .
then on the disarmament agenda : last december , mr solana , you gave a very good speech here in parliament on your ideas and those of the council and the union on promoting an agenda that is positive , by starting to support the  |||  americans  |||  and the russians to renegotiate the start treaty and to work with the americans on the ratification of the comprehensive nuclear - test - ban treaty .
|||  although  |||  this is below the threshold provided for by the regulation , the commission examined the application on the basis of the so - called ' extraordinary regional disaster ' criterion .
still on the subject of adapting to climate change , i  |||  agree  |||  that there is an urgent need to implement the new framework directive on soil protection , and that cohesion policy , water protection policy and the natura 2000 network need to be adapted to cope with the expected impacts .
the workers are obviously determined to defend their rights and have  |||  adopted  |||  as their standard the words of the 22 - year - old worker nikos nikopoulos in his open letter to the public prosecutor to the supreme court of appeal in greece , in which he says , among other things :
at the same time a great deal has been achieved in the area of the climate and energy package , and  |||  agreement  |||  was reached within the council on the third liberalisation package in the area of gas and electricity .
i must say that this causes me a certain degree of frustration , since we had all  |||  agreed  |||  that the issue of the application of community law was a priority in the ' better regulation ' agenda .
when i see that , for example , more than eur 100 million worth of weapons were supplied to yemen  |||  alone  |||  last year by no fewer than eight european countries , i wonder if the european common position on arms exports actually means anything at all .
mr president , the hungarian presidency is very pleased that this  |||  agreement  |||  was reached with the european parliament , and i am sure that the measure debated now and awaiting adoption by parliament can lead to an increase in economic efficiency and a decrease in the negative environmental impacts in the transport sector , and that as a result , european union citizens will be the winners of this directive being adopted .
this can be seen from a blatant campaign by government  |||  agencies  |||  against peaceful protestant house churches of late .
if goodness is a problem , then the  |||  answer  |||  -- or at the least part of the answer -- can be found in evolutionary biology .

one issue which is of increasing concern  |||  across  |||  europe is that of human trafficking , which involves victims from both within and outside the eu .
however ,  |||  another  |||  provision is also involved - a provision which is also important in my view - and that is article 13 of the european act of 1976 relating to the election of members of parliament .
the european approach meant that various factors could be taken into  |||  account  |||  that should always be taken into account when something extraordinary happens such as what we are going through at the moment .
the proposal for the creation of the erasmus first job programme , which i presented alongside mr fernandes , is based on the following principles : firstly ,  |||  additional  |||  funding for existing programmes in the fields of education , science , training and innovation ; and secondly , each case will have a training component and a component in which the trainee will have a contract with an innovative european company and will be cofunded by the european budget .
while i must mention in passing that it is  |||  always  |||  good to present brief papers , this one is also a shallow paper , a thin paper , from which we can learn nothing about the direction this journey is supposed to take .
the union should also inform citizens when their views have been taken into  |||  account  |||  and explain what the implications of those views have been .
it is , therefore , time to move to  |||  another  |||  and more resolute phase of reaction to what is going on in belarus .

in the past , when my european friends have asked me why the us lags so far behind europe in matters of animal welfare , i have had no  |||  answer  |||  .

in the united states , at least , we have learned that there is little risk to accumulating more government debt until interest and inflation rates begin to rise  |||  above  |||  normal levels , or the stock market tanks .
|||  although  |||  at the moment attempts are being made at european level to adopt a directive on geological capture and storage of co2 as quickly as possible , there is a shortage of appropriate initiatives at national or regional level , which are particularly necessary in the area of transport infrastructure .
i would like to point out that the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon is going to have a fundamental influence on the work of the committee ,  |||  although  |||  adapting the committee 's work to the new requirements of the treaty is a goal which will require further effort .
promoting a political  |||  agreement  |||  , firstly between the drc and rwanda , and then between the congolese government , the cndp and the other armed groups has made it possible , in the short term , to defuse the ticking time bomb of violence , although its potential for destabilisation today remains intact .

the future directive will not apply to seconded workers or to students , will  |||  allow  |||  discrimination based on criteria such as knowledge of the language and will refuse family benefits to families of seasonal workers .
thanks to the group of the greens / european free alliance , an  |||  adopted  |||  amendment also calls for member states to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship , as a crime .
what i wished to propose , unsuccessfully , as an oral  |||  amendment  |||  to the recital part , would be : ' whereas the intervention of the european parliament in the proceedings of national parliaments at the earliest stage of work on any proposed legislation is contrary to the fundamental principle of sovereignty and subsidiarity of member states and therefore compromises the european parliament as ever more linked to former soviet practices ' , etc. as adopted .
moreover , the provisions proposed by the commission for monitoring  |||  action  |||  by the member states and the help provided to them when the necessary corrective measures are taken have been retained and strengthened .

the candidate who came in first , with two - thirds of the vote , was abd al-mahir ghuneim , who is increasingly being spoken of as abbas 's successor . ghuneim is an unrepentant hardliner and an open opponent of the oslo  |||  agreement  |||  , much less of a negotiated peace agreement with israel .
i frequently hear comments from polish entrepreneurs that  |||  access  |||  to the relevant sources of information is very dispersed , which makes it much more difficult for users to compare and evaluate , and to draw the right conclusions concerning their own projects .
it is not by chance , with the approach of the elections to parliament , that resolutions are appearing that attempt to retract the responsibilities of policies  |||  adopted  |||  by the eu ( in particular in the last 5 years ) concerning the very serious situation in which micro , small and medium - sized enterprises generally find themselves , especially in portugal .
it is a case of ensuring compliance with european legislation and of defending a member 's activities , as we are dealing with an  |||  alleged  |||  crime of opinion regarding facts in the public domain .
capitalism could be reconstructed after world war ii because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation : social security , which served as a principal stabilizer , at least in the developed countries ; keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns ; and a universal high - wage policy  |||  aimed  |||  at stimulating general consumption , without which the genius of capitalism -- mass production -- does not work .
we spoke about azerbaijan in the last parliamentary term , when we  |||  adopted  |||  three resolutions , including one about freedom of the media there .
when presenting this proposal three months ago , the commission started with an observation : if an  |||  accident  |||  takes place in europe on board a vessel on the sea or on a river , the victims will not be properly compensated in so far as the applicable rules differ too much from one member state to another and in fact also appear to be in the main out of date .

in conjunction with two airports - vienna and bratislava , two ports on the danube river - vienna and bratislava  |||  again  |||  , and motorway junctions , a new and important logistics and transportation hub is being created right in the centre of europe .

the enforcement of the rights of citizens of one nation in  |||  another  |||  member state is of particular significance to small and medium - sized enterprises , and we should ensure that in future broadband continues to be used for the benefit of the population and prices drop , because with the very dynamic development of broadband services and the internet that is currently taking place , especially in the area of telephony , we have completely new possibilities for the use of broadband .

even during a trip to libya as commissioner for transport , i noticed the desire to reverse a trend which had  |||  always  |||  existed in the past .
this initiative aims to  |||  adopt  |||  a broader concept of what should be considered trafficking and i believe that exploitation for begging , including the use of a trafficked - dependent person for begging , regardless of his or her relationship with the perpetrators , must fall within this scope .

second , the idea that emerging - market economies could fully decouple from economic weakness in  |||  advanced  |||  economies was far - fetched : recession in the eurozone , near - recession in the united kingdom and japan in 2011-2012 , and slow economic growth in the united states were always likely to affect emerging - market performance negatively -- via trade , financial links , and investor confidence .
as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , i would like to point briefly to the three elements that we believe are essential -  |||  although  |||  we also have a very broad consensus regarding other elements - and which we wished to highlight when drawing up our opinion .

last but not least , i firmly believe that better use will be made of the  |||  added  |||  value generated by the film industry in member states .
associated with this is the fact that european legislation and the  |||  actions  |||  of the european institutions are bound by values and value - based decisions , along with the first sentence of this charter , which is also the most noble : human dignity is inviolable .
europe must realise that decisions made now will  |||  affect  |||  the future of the whole food system .

i was pleased to receive a report on the very positive welcome of the renewed social  |||  agenda  |||  by member states and i await with interest the conclusions which the council should receive by the end of this year .
that said , it is correct that there have been intense negotiations since february and that we have thus reached an  |||  agreement  |||  at first reading on the two proposals presented by the commission at the end of 2008 .
the best way to accentuate the region 's growing anti -  |||  american  |||  sentiment is to try to close the us - mexican border ( which will be futile ) .

indeed this is only way for peace to be  |||  achieved  |||  in that region .
( lt ) mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your  |||  answer  |||  .
the current proposals would allow the eu to overrule national regulators , and the danger is that technical standards may be used to  |||  actually  |||  make and dictate policy choices at an eu level .

we hope that there will soon be better regulation of the internet  |||  aimed  |||  at protecting children and taking more effective measures against providers that host child pornography websites .
|||  another  |||  thing you can read in this report is that the further growth of air transport will depend on it being co2 - neutral .
|||  according  |||  to articles 206 and 207 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) , foreign direct investment ( fdi ) is an exclusive competence of the eu .
the report by mrs giannakou specifically  |||  aims  |||  to promote the establishment of political parties at european level , and it therefore had my backing .
|||  although  |||  it still has work to do in the areas of politics , the judiciary , public administration , the fight against corruption , and freedom of expression , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has made significant progress in areas such as decentralisation , education , and prison system reform .

should you take  |||  another  |||  card , split , double or even fit ?
after she began her series of reports , husseini received death threats at her office  |||  almost  |||  daily -- as well as hundreds of letters of support from readers .
but , whatever the cause or effect , spending  |||  always  |||  goes up whenever groups decide to spend more -- and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else 's .
i am also delighted , mrs dati , that the council meeting on 25 july proved to be so fruitful , with a political  |||  agreement  |||  on the three texts .
this is absolutely necessary for an effective preventive  |||  action  |||  .
( es ) mr president , i am going to indicate the points on which i  |||  agree  |||  and disagree with the presidency and also say what was lacking , in my opinion , from the presidency 's speech .
that  |||  again  |||  shows how much we need to invest in the european budget 's operational capacities to react .
in addition , we call on the commission to propose a review of its mandate in order to resolve the legal vacuum that hinders its  |||  action  |||  in maritime rescue and repatriation operations .
this report , drafted by mrs ford , is on the legislative proposal for amending council regulation ( ec ) no 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure , which is part of the economic governance package ,  |||  adopted  |||  by the commission on 29 september 2010 , seeking to ' anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances ' so as to make the eu more robust and sustainable .
thus , employers need no longer honour the obligations imposed on them under labour and insurance legislation ( such as insurance contributions ) and are absolved of any liability , such as compensation for  |||  accidents  |||  at work .
i think it is extremely likely that issues such as iran ,  |||  afghanistan  |||  / pakistan , the south caucasus and , of course , the middle east will be raised .
we insist that third countries respect their international obligations , notably the world trade organisation sps  |||  agreement  |||  , making sure that , when setting requirements , they respect international standards or base their requirements on science .
booking.com : hotels near presidio of san francisco , united states of  |||  america  |||  .
of course , the evaluation mechanisms must proceed from being intergovernmental systems to being union systems , as recently  |||  announced  |||  by mrs malmström , just as the governance of schengen certainly produces increased cooperation and dynamic reinforcement , as well as modernisation , transparency and dialogue .
in my opinion , bulgaria has acted in a very disappointing way by signing a bilateral  |||  agreement  |||  on energy with the russian federation .
in this connection , the commission could also add  |||  another  |||  key point , and that is to concentrate on fresh organic produce .
mr lechner 's report certainly reflects a tremendous  |||  amount  |||  of work , on which i congratulate him , but i think that the task now , in the final stage of the process , is to strike a compromise that will enable us to demonstrate the importance that we as parliamentarians ascribe to the consumer .
we would like to improve the status of groups for whom new technology brings opportunities , but which will leave them with no  |||  access  |||  to the information society unless their rights are monitored .
moreover , in my view , the text agreed and voted upon today  |||  advocates  |||  parliament 's prerogatives under the ordinary legislative procedure and includes the necessary changes arising from articles 290 ( e ) and 291 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu .
tonight , we seem to be being asked to grant the powers to the commission without first being told exactly what action they will be used to  |||  address  |||  .
they act  |||  according  |||  to clear , sacred rules .
item 2 : the title of the debate on the situation in tunisia will be  |||  amended  |||  as follows : ' statement by the vice - president of the commission / high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy on the situation in the mediterranean , in particular in tunisia and egypt ' .
this would send a clear message to the council about what europeans want , which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice , to be protected , and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to  |||  another  |||  country .
however , we cannot do so before both sides signal a genuine willingness to put the european future of albania  |||  above  |||  party politics and personal mistrust .
|||  annual  |||  gdp grew by more than 3 % in 2010 and 2011 , because a still - booming chinese economy was sustaining high demand for german machines and cars ; but , as china 's gdp growth has slowed , so has germany 's , to an annual rate of less than 1 % .
this is almost unique  |||  among  |||  all un missions : it is the only one without a human rights mandate .
that is why i am pleased to thank both colleagues and give my thanks  |||  again  |||  to the commission and to the council .
since 2004 , salih osman has been committing himself to the establishment and  |||  administration  |||  of the amal centre in nyala , amal being arabic for ' hope ' , for the rehabilitation of victims of violence and sexual abuse .
in the conciliation , we will finally have the opportunity , i hope , to talk sensibly and equally about  |||  added  |||  value and subsidiarity , about positive and negative priorities and , at the same time , about the urgent political requirements .
i would like us to  |||  actually  |||  start doing something , instead of just churning out more pages and setting deadlines .
( de ) mr president , the eu has four  |||  agencies  |||  in the field of employment , working conditions and vocational training ; namely , the european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions ( eurofound ) , the european training foundation ( etf ) , the european agency for safety and health ( osha ) and the european centre for the development of vocational training ( cedefop ) , with an annual budget of around eur 15 million to eur 20 million .
however , we should not forget that businesses operate in the common european market and often conduct their  |||  activities  |||  in different member states .
this question should equally have been asked of the commission in terms of initiating a new legislative proposal to tighten up the relevant legislation so that we can deal with them , but pending that my  |||  advice  |||  to any small business faced with demands from european city guide and similar guides is simple : do not pay ; ignore them ; ignore the pressure .
in  |||  addition  |||  , a process has unarguably been set in motion regarding relations between taiwan and mainland china , which is also proven by the establishment of direct flights and the conclusion of an economic cooperation framework agreement between them .
the text  |||  adopted  |||  today aims to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the prespa park area , including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans , in accordance with international and eu standards .
it is very important for smes to have  |||  access  |||  to public procurement procedures .
if possible , i would also add the option of access to the global adjustment fund for areas that may be affected by this  |||  agreement  |||  .
this is a sister project to the north stream pipeline ,  |||  aimed  |||  at making it totally impossible to implement the nabucco project .
in writing . - the key  |||  amendments  |||  on prior authorisation failed .
indeed , the council has  |||  always  |||  considered that the citizens ' initiative , as an element of citizen participation in european decisions , should go hand - in - hand with the other element , that is , the election of the european parliament .
in writing . - i cannot support this report or  |||  amendment  |||  6 as i feel that it is inappropriate to include tax - or vat - based issues in a health - based report such as this .
it needs to be made clear that investors should only invest if they  |||  actually  |||  understand the product and cannot use the excuse that they can , to a certain extent , automatically make a triple a product the goal of their investment strategy .
according to the  |||  agreement  |||  reached at the last session of the european council , all the member states of the european union and other mediterranean countries will participate in the barcelona process , that is to say the mediterranean union .
the final draft of the  |||  agenda  |||  for this sitting , as agreed by the conference of presidents at their meeting on thursday 8 january 2009 , in accordance with rules 130 and 131 of the rules of procedure , has been circulated .
lastly , one element missing for me is the digital  |||  agenda  |||  .
if there must be time limited individual support  |||  aimed  |||  at assisting workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation , such support must relate to real individual needs and the real economic context .
in  |||  addition  |||  to the humanitarian and other actions i have described , it is worth mentioning that on tuesday in luxembourg the european investment bank and chile - this was mentioned by an honourable member - signed a framework agreement to enable the bank to operate in chile .
the existence of such negative incentives is why bankruptcy law in america allows bankruptcy judges discretion to force recalcitrant creditors to  |||  accept  |||  a resolution that is in the broader interest .
since excessive regulation cannot be a solution , the delegation has defended the  |||  amendment  |||  rejecting the commission 's proposal , as existing texts on this issue have not yet been applied in some member states that are subject to infringement procedures .
mr cashman , a very good and normally unbelievably efficient colleague , has already pointed out that the most important thing is to give the public  |||  access  |||  to documents that are discussed and decided upon here .
i would like , mr president , to call for solidarity to be shown to those  |||  affected  |||  by the floods which have occurred in romania recently .
as  |||  another  |||  important factor in the debate , us treasury secretary lawrence summers issued his own calls for modest world bank reforms , following proposals that he made earlier for modest imf reforms .
furthermore , and among other important aspects , we disagree with the eib having the objective of completing the single market by financing infrastructures  |||  aimed  |||  at liberalising markets - as is the case with energy - or that the emphasis should be placed on financing ' public - private partnerships ' following a policy of using public funds to finance major private capital .
ensuring that all children have  |||  access  |||  to education and support structures in their earliest childhood must become a right both for parents , especially for mothers , but , above all , for children themselves , because it means that they can lay solid foundations for their education , be supported in their social integration and personal development , and have a better chance of finding a job once they become adults .
amendment 4 and amendments 18 and 19 cannot be accepted , since the text proposed by the commission is correct - in the case of amendment 4 - or is sufficiently clear - in the case of  |||  amendments  |||  18 and 19 .
the commission , certainly , considers that this approach and methodology is unsound , particularly in categories 1a and 1b , where we talk about innovation and research , even more so as we have an  |||  additional  |||  problem with the european institute of technology and the galileo programme , which has to be solved as an additional parallel problem of the annual european budget procedures .
it is particularly ironic that states who have already  |||  achieved  |||  a great deal in this area are being given additional ambitious tasks .
|||  added  |||  to that , a problem which is obvious to me is that most of the people that are mentioned are current prime ministers of different european countries .
you can download a couple of image files the size of a floppy disk or  |||  another  |||  removable media of similar small size , write them to the media , and then start the installation by booting from that .
the policy framework document and the political statement  |||  adopted  |||  in helsinki represent a turning point for the northern dimension , insofar as they turn the policy into a joint policy shared by all the northern dimension partners , that is , the eu , russia , norway and iceland .
trialogues have been initiated to seek an  |||  agreement  |||  with the council .
as long as us assets were attractive to residents of surplus countries ( or there was an  |||  acceptable  |||  chain of investments from surplus countries that ended in the us ) , these accumulations of reserves were sustainable .
restrictions on market  |||  access  |||  due to poor roads , insufficient electricity , and limited access to investment financing excluded most locals from the new argan oil markets .
but we are putting all the emphasis on member states and very little on what is behind some market  |||  activity  |||  .
hence , we have established the transparency register , in mutual  |||  agreement  |||  between parliament and the commission with the hope that the council will soon join the agreement .
we believe that the  |||  adopted  |||  resolution falls well short of what , in our view , origin marking should be , which is to say , among other things , an instrument to protect industrial jobs in europe , particularly in small and medium - sized enterprises , and an instrument to tackle social and environmental dumping .
this extension will  |||  allow  |||  us to avoid a regulatory vacuum after 30 june this year and will enable the fisheries to carry on their business until the reform of the cfp .
it is with satisfaction that i am voting vote for this  |||  agreement  |||  , given its ambitious nature and the possibilities that it opens up for making the historical ties that exist between the azores and canada even closer .
i therefore propose that we increase the coordination of this development aid with a broader  |||  agreement  |||  between donor countries , financial institutions and partners , and manage it more efficiently and transparently so that it does not generate costs and is not a bureaucratic burden .
i appeal to europe to contribute generously and wholeheartedly , but that is only if guarantees are given that our contribution will  |||  actually  |||  go to the right place and that journalists will also be allowed into the country , so that we can get a proper picture of the situation there .
these have to be assessed on an individual basis  |||  according  |||  to our legislation .
we have already come to an  |||  agreement  |||  , after all , on the water regime in the entire danube region .
i believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate  |||  among  |||  european democracies .
i have long believed that gdp understates growth even in rich countries , where its measurement is quite sophisticated , because it is very difficult to compare the value of baskets of goods  |||  across  |||  different time periods .
the introduction of a financial transaction tax is a step in the right direction and would mainly  |||  affect  |||  hedge funds and similar products , which would seem to be of very little benefit to the real economy .
in the current phase with dr elbaradei , as you know , iran has to  |||  answer  |||  questions about important issues like weaponisation , and especially other issues related to contamination , which are very important .
the us economy has many other strengths , including its superior financial system and leading position in high - tech capital goods , but the fact remains that america 's  |||  advantage  |||  in these areas has so far not been nearly as striking as the wal - mart phenomenon .
the current situation in bahrain - which is of strategic importance with regard to the equilibrium in the gulf - and which , underneath the appearance of normality , is very tense , with the ongoing detention of people who are  |||  accused  |||  of nothing more than violating the right to free expression .
first of all , it should at last take  |||  action  |||  and decisions , and should develop an ambitious job creation programme .
the final draft  |||  agenda  |||  as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of thursday , 20 january 2011 , pursuant to rule 137 of the rules of procedure , has been distributed .
i do not believe that any religion which  |||  aims  |||  to do good could require something like this from its followers .
on derivatives , there is now general  |||  agreement  |||  on how to approach trading , clearing , and transparency , but much more work to do on capital requirements , margin requirements , clearinghouse supervision , and other issues .
if your internet provider requires automatic proxy , please enter the web  |||  address  |||  provided by your isp .
i would like to confirm that , besides the communication that i have given on this subject , we will propose legislation at the start of 2011 which provides for the creation of these precaution or bank resolution funds to implement the principle of ' the polluter pays ' while emphasising  |||  another  |||  idea , which i would repeat here , namely , that prevention always costs less than cure .
this is not , however , the specific issue being debated today , which is the framework  |||  agreement  |||  with libya .
where we have not been able to reach  |||  affected  |||  populations is in the western part of libya under the control of gaddafi .
after the vote on  |||  amendment  |||  32
that is how  |||  america  |||  's founders , such as james madison and alexander hamilton , envisioned that things would work .
obviously , like any other programme of such size , it should be clear , coherent , regularly monitored and assessed after each implementation phase , in order to allow ( re ) adjustments , especially as regards the priorities of implementing the  |||  actions  |||  .
if you are at home or abroad your hsbc premier credit card will provide you with instant access to finances in more than 24 million places all over the world where it is  |||  accepted  |||  .

the hudson cafeteria is located on - site and features a variety of classic  |||  american  |||  dishes created with modern inspiration .
the trustees of the us medicare trust funds ( providing medical services to the retired ) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $ 5.9 trillion -- 50 % larger than  |||  america  |||  's official publicly - held national debt .
i am determined to pursue my objectives and i am confident that i can count on the support of the european parliament in order to achieve a good agreement with the us , an agreement which will ensure a high level of data protection for all individuals and  |||  allow  |||  us to pursue the necessary and important cooperation with the united states to prevent terrorism and organised crime .
i also remain concerned that some of the  |||  amendments  |||  regarding the treatment of equity risk could result in the introduction of an imprudent regime for investment in risk - based capital .
let me also say that when i look at the finance and fiscal position , the fiscal position of the major  |||  advanced  |||  economies , i can say that europe as a whole and the eu area in particular is in a better situation - mr goebbels said this - than japan or the us in terms of public financial deficit .
in  |||  addition  |||  to other measures , it is therefore important for administrative structures to be developed , because a new border needs to be managed and also monitored .
' the commission has certain doubts that some of the future acts which the commission has been given the power to  |||  adopt  |||  by the legislative act would be implementing acts .
these include : amendment 11 on demographic trends , amendment 25 stressing the need for better harmonisation between working and family life , amendment 50 on support for member states in promoting part - time work , amendment 35 on optional maternity leave before birth , amendment 53 clarifying that women on maternity leave may have their salaries raised , and  |||  amendment  |||  56 on workers ' retirement rights .

in comparison with 2008 , payments under expenditure sub - heading 1b have decreased by  |||  almost  |||  14 % .
today , at a meeting of the rapporteurs and representatives of all political groups , organised by the chair of the committee on industry , ms niebler , we unanimously  |||  agreed  |||  to propose to begin the trialogue as early as possible , preferably in strasbourg in the week starting 12 january 2009 , considering the time constraints .
we cannot regulate everything  |||  according  |||  to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction .
if the economy declines  |||  again  |||  -- a highly plausible prospect -- we would have a triple dip , although perhaps not an outright second recession .
i share the belief that without a global  |||  agreement  |||  , all of our efforts will come to nothing .
the justifications submitted are the  |||  amendments  |||  that have been introduced in the interim .
help the penguins in their pursuit of the devious dr. blowhole  |||  across  |||  the planet !
poor children do not have reasonable  |||  access  |||  to health care .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur 's approach urging the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones .
today 's vote by the european parliament should therefore provide  |||  additional  |||  impetus for this process thanks to the unanimous support from across the political groups .
regrettably , however , due to pressure from the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , the other signatories have  |||  allowed  |||  the importance of the resolution to be diluted and its power to be undermined , with the inclusion of a reference to the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs .
the commission has proposed to exempt 50 % of the tractors manufactured in the eu in the last five years because of the technological development time lag , which makes it impossible - unless an enormous amount of money is spent - to carry out the mechanical modifications necessary to move on to the next stage , and because of the economic crisis affecting the tractor market , which has seen a 20 %  |||  annual  |||  fall in its turnover since 2008 .
today , in contrast to the right , the left has a coherent  |||  agenda  |||  , one that offers not only higher growth , but also social justice .
this budgetary procedure , once  |||  again  |||  , provides clear evidence of the eu 's intended response to the worsening capitalist crisis , triggered by the financial crisis at the very heart of the system , in other words in the us .
this  |||  allowed  |||  us to make concrete progress on implementation of the eu 's six - point ceasefire plan between russia and georgia .
it has derived powers , which  |||  allow  |||  it to take measures to implement texts adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure .
i voted in favour of the report on the european urban  |||  agenda  |||  and its future in cohesion policy , as it underlines the importance of forming networks of cities , sharing best practices and adopting innovative solutions , strengthening the urban dimension of the objective of european territorial cooperation , as well as implementing the partnership principle more effectively in cohesion policy , with a view to the more sustainable development of cities , particularly as regards the modernisation of infrastructure and urban transport networks .
we need a joint  |||  action  |||  plan to help our fellow citizens , so that , tomorrow , we can invest in non - relocatable activities - for example , heavy infrastructure or a plan to bring buildings up to environmental standards .
i would like to made a peripheral comment on frontex : frontex  |||  always  |||  takes the names of its operations from greek mythology ; nautilus is one example .
such positions nevertheless underestimate the future price of fossil fuels and disregard the substantial  |||  advantages  |||  resulting from the rapid diffusion of renewable energies : for example , the security of energy supply , but above all the creation of new jobs , at a time of recession when thousands of workers are being forced out of production processes .
mr president , on 31 january , in this very chamber , we  |||  adopted  |||  with a large majority the parliament 's resolution clearly requesting the european commission to create an eu roma strategy .
the aim of the new regulation is therefore to  |||  allow  |||  manufacturers , users and consumers quicker access to innovative products containing new fibres ; a subject close to the hearts of european consumers , sector enterprises - including both textile and clothing businesses - and also national administrations .
i therefore fully support david martin 's report recommending acceptance of the cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu and south korea in the matter of anti - competitive activity .
i deplore that there was not enough support from the other groups to come to an  |||  agreement  |||  on that .
this can also be seen this year , when once  |||  again  |||  there is nothing like a realistic budget for aid to palestine and kosovo .
however , we know that  |||  among  |||  the 27 member states there are varying levels of awareness , resources and expertise available to counter the problem .
our cooperation has  |||  actually  |||  enabled us to balance out various objectives , namely easier access to capital for smes and the removal of administrative hurdles , on the one hand , and improvement and securing of investor protection and making progress in terms of creating a genuine european internal market , on the other .
restoring competitiveness in some member countries ( spain , greece ) would require others ( germany in the first instance ) to  |||  accept  |||  deterioration in theirs .
in writing . - ( fr ) the competitiveness of european industry needs to be placed at the heart of the community agenda , for this alone will  |||  allow  |||  us to create skilled jobs , secure europe 's economic growth , guarantee the survival of the european welfare system and ensure that the eu can remain a major trading power in the 21st century .
the point behind my question is that we should be aware that our younger constituents in particular - and i am sure i am not the only one in this situation - want to urge both this presidency in its mid - term , and also the swedish presidency , to look carefully at what the  |||  americans  |||  are trying to do in ensuring that there is no conflict - and mr vondra did mention this - between tackling the urgent priority of the economic crisis , unemployment and so on , and encouraging action on climate change , promoting the climate change package and encouraging industries to be involved in the low - carbon economy .
in writing . - ( pt ) one of the greatest dangers in the debate on terrorism and its causes is to fall into one of two extremes : on the one hand , in seeking to understand everything , the perception that everything becomes acceptable and justifiable ; on the other , the refusal to recognise different realities that makes everything confused and that groups everything  |||  according  |||  to the same concepts and standards .
this  |||  agreement  |||  will be subject to review every three years after its approval by both parties .
|||  again  |||  , none .
i would also like to point out that there is still insufficient funding for the fight against tuberculosis , and it is necessary to provide for specific funding mechanisms that will contribute to the licensing in europe of tuberculosis vaccines , vaccine  |||  accessibility  |||  , clinical research into tuberculosis and more effective diagnosis and treatment , and money allocated to healthcare services must reach countries ' poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
|||  among  |||  the returning guest actors ( and characters ) were mark lenard ( as sarek ) , roger c. carmel ( as harry mudd ) , and stanley adams ( as cyrano jones ) .
finally , i regret that parliament has been unwilling to  |||  adopt  |||  a more contemporary approach as far as access to the documents is concerned : i say yes , a thousand times yes to multilingualism .
whilst it is  |||  acceptable  |||  to combat racism - and by racism i mean the specific incitement to or the use of violence - it is not acceptable to confuse this concept with legitimate public debate , such as opposition to mass immigration , opposition to islamisation or the defence of national identity .
however , i would like to use this new process of recovery of the internal market and of the digital  |||  agenda  |||  - which , incidentally , mr monti spoke of in his report - to develop a real economic policy for the cultural sector in europe .
