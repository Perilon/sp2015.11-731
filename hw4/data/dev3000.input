right - wing populists triumph in austria , have  |||  total  |||  of 29 percent
according to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a  |||  significant  |||  boost for the right - wing populist parties .
the austrian people 's party ( övp ) , where the position of the  |||  current  |||  head , wilhelm molterer , is being severely jolted , suffered particularly great losses .
conversely , the campaign leader of the alliance for the future of austria ( bzö ) , carinthian governor jörg haider , is preparing a triumphant return to  |||  national  |||  politics .
according to the preliminary results , the social democratic party ( spö ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes , however , it has  |||  lost  |||  5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006 .
övp , which with its 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of  |||  votes  |||  , fared even worse .
these are the worst results of both  |||  large  |||  parties in austrian post - war history , and particularly for the people 's party , who urged the early elections , it is literally a catastrophic result .
at the beginning of july , when övp left the coalition , the people 's party still had a  |||  significant  |||  lead on spö in the polls .
voters , however , apparently punished them for letting the  |||  government  |||  flounder .
such a development would certainly simplify the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results , that is , the renewal of the  |||  large  |||  coalition of spö and övp .
given the strengthening of both right - wing populist parties - the freedom party ( fpö ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and bzö eleven percent of the votes - however , at the same time , the social democrats expressed fear of a repetition of the year 1999 , when the people 's party  |||  agreed  |||  with the populists ( fpö was still united at that time , it broke away from bzö in 2005 ) on a common government , which eventually provoked sanctions from the european union .
haider , who has already announced that he is  |||  prepared  |||  to work together with any party and presumes he will return to vienna to national politics , is evidently banking on this development .
the green party also got into the parliament , but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to  |||  fifth  |||  place among austrian political parties .
schwarzenberg :  |||  relations  |||  with india could worsen
according to foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , if it will not be possible to solve the problem of the czech scientists charged in india with the  |||  illegal  |||  collection of beetles , a certain worsening of czech - indian relations could take place .
the minister made this statement in new york following today 's  |||  meeting  |||  with his indian counterpart , pranab mukherjee .
" if it is not solved , then yes , then a  |||  certain  |||  worsening would take place , " he states following the meeting initiated from the czech side .
following the negotiations , mukherjee said that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial  |||  matters  |||  .
nevertheless , he said that in the case of petr švácha , who was cleared of the charges and penalized with a  |||  fine  |||  , the central government can negotiate with the local government in darjeeling , under the jurisdiction of which the matter belongs .
" his problem could be solved , " the  |||  minister  |||  said .
he can then request to be  |||  released  |||  on bail and wait for the verdict outside of jail , he explained .
schwarzenberg  |||  confirmed  |||  that his partner had also said this during the negotiations .
" he recommends appealing to a higher court , then it would be  |||  possible  |||  to pardon him , " the head of czech diplomacy said .
the only way the czech side can become involved in the whole matter is to  |||  provide  |||  the sentenced individuals with " competent legal support " , the indian minister said .
at the same time , he said that the indian side is already also  |||  providing  |||  them with aid of this type .
" it is in our greatest interest to  |||  maintain  |||  the best relations with india , which have a long - standing tradition .
the indians also  |||  acknowledge  |||  this , " schwarzenberg said .
the minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the indian side to pursue the  |||  matter  |||  .
czech referees  |||  battle  |||  for ocean floor
however , he is not interested in the continent , but in a small point  |||  lost  |||  in the blue of the ocean .
at the same time , the area is as large as the continent  |||  itself  |||  , " says italian lawyer luigi santosuosso , who belongs to the thirty - member team of employees of the un division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea .
his boss , the division director , czech lawyer václav mikulka ,  |||  follows  |||  what he is saying and occasionally adds something .
zest and  |||  enthusiasm  |||  for work are dominant here .
the ocean floor shelters a thus far  |||  little  |||  known world rich in natural resources .
it is possible to find oil , ores , and other minerals , but also thus far unknown  |||  living  |||  organisms that hold the key , for example , to the development of a cure for cancer .
a floor  |||  larger  |||  than the continent
coastal  |||  countries  |||  today have begun to vehemently compete for the new underwater territory .
that is , according to a un agreement they are utilizing the rights on which they  |||  agreed  |||  in 1982 in montego bay , jamaica .
this is mainly the area of the so - called continental shelf , which often reaches up to several  |||  hundred  |||  kilometers from the coast of the given country .
the request the given country submits to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation  |||  based  |||  on many costly surveys and measurements .
it is the result of many  |||  years  |||  of preparatory work .
" one of our  |||  roles  |||  is to provide the commission with legal and specialized technical assistance .
recently the  |||  success  |||  of australia , which was the first to expand its underwater domain , was registered worldwide .
but new zealand gained as well - the area of the ocean floor that the commission conceded to it is around 1.6 million square kilometers , that is , roughly six times bigger than the size of the country  |||  itself  |||  .
both countries  |||  invested  |||  millions of dollars into surveying .
other countries will also gradually  |||  submit  |||  their requests .
they have until ten years from the  |||  moment  |||  when they ratified the " montego bay agreement " to do so .
where the continental shelf ends , the area of the ocean floor declared by the agreement as the "  |||  common  |||  heritage of humankind " begins .
here no country has any  |||  exclusive  |||  position any longer .
mining rights in this area are  |||  granted  |||  through the agreement established by the international institution .
" but the ocean floor is no klondike " , director mikulka says exaggeratedly , adding that his "  |||  individual  |||  areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is anchored in contracts . "
czechs in the  |||  pacific  |||
part of the ocean floor  |||  currently  |||  belongs to the czech republic .
it shares it with other countries from the  |||  former  |||  eastern bloc as a part of the common organization " interoceanmetal " .
by agreement , this organization , like the investors of several  |||  small  |||  other countries , gained the status of so - called " pioneering investor " in 1991 .
the area is a rich locality for the collection of poly - metal concretions containing nickel , copper , cobalt and manganese , " says  |||  another  |||  lawyer , pakshi rajan from india .
in solving the hostage crisis , the egyptian government had requested  |||  help  |||  from germany - which sent in the experts .
when push came to shove , the special forces were  |||  ready  |||  , but their services were not required in the end .
more and more  |||  details  |||  are surfacing on the circumstances surrounding the liberation of the eleven european tourists abducted in egypt .
according to the german federal ministries of defense and of the interior , german special forces indirectly took part in the  |||  rescue  |||  mission .
the egyptian government had  |||  accepted  |||  the help offered by germany to rely on the german forces as backup during the operation .
' luckily , it did n't come to that , ' a spokesman of the german  |||  federal  |||  ministry of the interior said .
after their abduction in a  |||  desert  |||  region in the south of egypt , the hostages had been carried back and forth in the border region between egypt , libya , sudan and chad .
german foreign minister steinmeier said they have been entrusted to the care of the  |||  german  |||  embassy .
he did not comment on the  |||  details  |||  of the rescue .
according to german newspaper ' bild , ' the five tourists and the special forces are to board an airbus of the  |||  german  |||  air force , which is said to arrive in germany on tuesday .
u.s.  |||  house  |||  of representatives rejects bailout
the 700 billion dollar  |||  bailout  |||  package for the financial markets narrowly failed to pass in the first of the two chambers of the u.s. congress .
with a vote of 227 to 206 against , the u.s. house of representatives  |||  rejected  |||  the government 's bailout package for the financial markets .
in a dramatic campaign ,  |||  supporters  |||  had made desperate attempts to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar plan 's merits .
barney frank , one of the main democratic negotiators , had called on representatives for approval , even  |||  though  |||  it was an unpopular plan .
' it 's  |||  hard  |||  to get political approval for the prevention of something that has n't happened yet , ' he conceded .
while the vote was still underway , the dow jones saw a drop of more than six percent , or 600  |||  points  |||  .
for the plan to be implemented , the approval of both the  |||  house  |||  of representatives and the senate is required .
|||  travel  |||  agencies report increase in bookings
it 's going to be a good winter for  |||  german  |||  travel agencies , evidently :
a survey says that the turnover of bookings for the coming months has increased significantly versus the  |||  previous  |||  year - for the winter season by as much as 30 percent , even .
despite prospects of a weak economy , the germans ' appetite for travelling  |||  remains  |||  unspoiled , a survey says .
for bookings during the winter season , travel agencies saw an increase in turnover of 31 percent versus the same period of the previous year , the  |||  german  |||  travel association ( drv ) reported in berlin on monday .
travel agencies had seen an increase in turnover of approximately eleven percent for  |||  october  |||  versus 2007 , the drv said .
in this area , bookings had increased by approximately one  |||  third  |||  , it said .
that aside , it pointed out spain , turkey and greece as being popular among germans , as well as  |||  domestic  |||  regions .
all - inclusive trips were especially sought - after , drv  |||  president  |||  klaus laepple said .
in the light of  |||  increasing  |||  energy and food prices , their cost was ' more calculable for clients than that of individually organized vacations , ' said laepple .
consumers could save money through  |||  early  |||  - bird or all - inclusive discounts , among others , laepple said .
because the summer months had been very well - booked , as well , there would be another  |||  increase  |||  in turnover versus the previous year , he said - although another survey reports that the number of travelling germans sank compared to the previous year .
but there is one thing that connects us : we 've been at the wiesn for barely three minutes , and already the photographers are crowding around us and snapshooting away , filling up their  |||  memory  |||  cards - very flattering , and it 's my first visit to the wiesn , to boot .
the cheapo dirndl  |||  seems  |||  to be doing its job .
almost everyone is wearing dirndl or lederhosn ; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - it 's all totally  |||  normal  |||  .
only my dirndl apron drew weird glances at the chocolate -  |||  banana  |||  vendor .
' looks about right , ' she  |||  says  |||  , and laughs .
the  |||  young  |||  man with the exhibitionist attitude is called bob , is from england , and it 's his first time at the oktoberfest , as well .
|||  right  |||  next to one of those fireplugs that everybody mistakes for waste dumps .
|||  others  |||  are n't quite fortunate enough to lose the alcohol in this fashion .
it works like with most wiesn visitors : when it 's empty , they head out , and when it 's  |||  full  |||  , they come back .
' it 's the ones that ca n't take any more , ' one of the paramedics shouted when i asked him about it , disappearing in the  |||  crowd  |||  .
|||  accident  |||  victim named by police
carole paulson , of chelmsford  |||  road  |||  in brentwood , was involved in the accident on friday afternoon on shenfield road in the town .
she was taken to queen 's hospital , romford , but later  |||  died  |||  .
he has since been released on  |||  police  |||  bail .
turkey 's widening  |||  diplomatic  |||  horizons
long before turkey sought to  |||  join  |||  the european union , the european powers were eager to penetrate deep into turkey 's hinterland .
on the eastern side of the bosphorus , maybe just 20 steps into asia , stands one of the finest relics of this  |||  failed  |||  imperial ambition .
hydarpasha railway station was designed by two  |||  german  |||  architects otto ritter and helmut conu in the neo - renaissance style .
the stone is  |||  dirty  |||  .
but  |||  once  |||  inside the vaulted ticket office , there is no doubting the grandeur of the enterprise of which this was the westernmost gateway .
the station was  |||  opened  |||  in august 1908 by a german consortium , the anatolia - baghdad corporation .
germany , a latecomer to the imperial game , intended to realise its ambitions to dominate the middle east by means of this railway running to damascus , baghdad , and  |||  beyond  |||  into what today is saudi arabia .
but germany 's imperial ambitions foundered during the  |||  world  |||  war i.
british and dominion forces advanced out of egypt and pushed the turks and their  |||  german  |||  allies out of palestine and syria .
and there was bad  |||  news  |||  for hyderpasha station too .
in 1917 an ammunition  |||  train  |||  blew up destroying its elaborate roof .
|||  turkish  |||  sources say it was sabotage .
since then it has slowly mouldered away , largely bypassed by  |||  history  |||  .
the  |||  governing  |||  justice and development party - the akp - has crafted a whole new foreign policy for the country .
remarkably the turkish government has good relations with israel and syria , with the  |||  palestinian  |||  factions of hamas and fatah , with iraq and iran and of course with the european union and the united states .
to gauge the parameters of this new foreign policy , i boarded the night sleeper to the turkish capital ankara , to visit one of the akp 's  |||  leading  |||  foreign policy experts , turkish mp suat kiniklioglu .
the next morning - some ten and a half hours later - after a jolting ride along tracks that produced the old world cadences of the famous documentary the night mail , i arrived in the turkish capital -  |||  proposed  |||  as a new city for a new secular state intent on turning its back on the ottoman past .
but the akp with its well -  |||  known  |||  islamist roots represents a paradigm shift in the turkish consensus .
it has prompted some suspicion in the  |||  west  |||  , most notably in washington .
suat kiniklioglu could have been a centre - right politician from almost any other  |||  political  |||  party in europe .
suit , tie , i am  |||  sure  |||  he was even packing a blackberry .
|||  turkey  |||  had been cut off from its hinterland .
today it had to  |||  look  |||  eastwards and westwards at the same time .
" but surely at some  |||  point  |||  , " i asked , " turkey might be forced to choose ? "
" turkey , " he said , " did not want to have to face that  |||  choice  |||  . "
he then stressed a point that almost everyone i have spoken to here has recited almost by rote : turkey 's ties not just to the middle east , but to the caucasus , and around the black sea , are as much to the  |||  benefit  |||  of europe and the united states as they are to turkey .
how surprised they would have been to find that europe 's  |||  middle  |||  eastern ambitions may now , to a large part , be in turkey 's hands .
and as i waited at the terminal for the ferry to take me  |||  back  |||  across the bosphorus , i recalled that in those days turkey had always been called " the sick man of europe . "
then at least there did not  |||  seem  |||  to be much doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country .
mark brown writes : as guildford 's musical director from 1962 , vernon " tod " handley ( obituary , sept 11 ) had  |||  charge  |||  of the guildford philharmonic orchestra and choir .
as part of his music  |||  scheme  |||  for the borough , in the next year he founded his wonderful youth choir , proteus .
it was supposed to be for under - 21s , but by the time the proteus sang its finale in 1979 ,  |||  several  |||  of us were in our late 20s - we just refused to give the choir up .
the name " proteus " ( the mythological shape - changer ) represented the choir 's willingness and ability to tackle whatever music was  |||  presented  |||  to it , whether madrigal or messiaen , whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra .
the musical versatility produced by such a youth choir was often astonishing , always exciting , and it was all due to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music which remained absolutely constant  |||  throughout  |||  the years .
how often we were told by tod to " let the music  |||  speak  |||  for itself " .
he 'd say : " the composer knows what he  |||  wants  |||  .
it 's all there in the  |||  music  |||  .
his baton technique was absolutely  |||  clear  |||  and precise , though never dictatorial , nor florid .
|||  john  |||  frayn turner writes :
over the  |||  past  |||  40 - odd years , i have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and i can honestly say that i have never been disappointed with a single one - and many times inspired by them .
tod handley had that rare combination of greatness plus  |||  personal  |||  modesty .
he hated conductors who , in his words , simply " hawked one or two well - known war horses around the  |||  world  |||  " .
he will be  |||  missed  |||  by so many of us .
|||  william  |||  woodruff
professor  |||  john  |||  beckett writes :
your obituary of william woodruff ( sept 25 ) states that " in 1946 he resumed  |||  economic  |||  history at oxford and in 1950 became a houblon - norman research fellow ... while simultaneously studying for a bsc , an ma and a phd " .
this follows from woodruff 's author 's  |||  note  |||  in beyond nab end , but it is not correct .
from 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in  |||  economic  |||  history at the university of nottingham , during which time he completed a phd thesis on the british rubber industry , supervised by professor j. d. chambers , and subsequently published in 1958 as the british rubber industry .
in 1953 he  |||  left  |||  nottingham permanently for illinois .
" i recommend the exhibition of josé vicente resino " flamenco y vida , " because his black and white photographs , taken in  |||  documentary  |||  style , are extraordinary .
resino is able to capture magic  |||  moments  |||  . "
in addition , it is equipped with a fine mechanics which increases the driving comfort and permits to  |||  save  |||  fuel .

this is honda jazz '  |||  second  |||  generation .
while aesthetically the new jazz looks like the  |||  previous  |||  model , changes brought to the minivan are numerous .
among others , it is worth pointing out its  |||  innovative  |||  design , new platform , bigger size and pretty new mechanics .
anyway , before moving on to analyze the new model , may be useful to point out that this new jazz  |||  comes  |||  only six years after the entry of the first generation .
even if the jazz model is less  |||  known  |||  in europe than in other markets , it remains a phenomenon in terms of sales .
just there , almost a million units of jazz were  |||  sold  |||  from the model 's launch .
the second  |||  market  |||  was the old continent , with about half a million units sold in six years .
despite these numbers , honda believes this new jazz will increase even more its  |||  sales  |||  in the segment .
so , if in 2007 the japanese company  |||  sold  |||  a total of 83,000 units of this model , in 2009 it estimates it will be around 100,000 cars . this foresee a possible increase in sales of 17 % just in the european market .
regarding the spanish market , honda has  |||  sold  |||  a total of 8,000 units of jazz since 2002 , corresponding to 6.7 % of total sales for the company in spain .
the arrival of the new honda jazz will probably make it possible , by reducing the lowering of  |||  sales  |||  in spain to a large extent .
despite the increase in sales , honda has also incremented its market  |||  share  |||  in spain , reaching the 1.8 % , compared to the last year 1.6 % .
at the same time , the  |||  japanese  |||  company expects to reach the 2 % in 2010 .
to achieve this , honda is confident in  |||  another  |||  new model of its .
this is insight , a hybrid five - door compact car , 4.37 meters in length . the  |||  japanese  |||  company hopes to sell about 200,000 units of this model worldwide , within one year .
according to the markets and  |||  japanese  |||  manufacturers ' estimates , the 50 % of insight 's sale will come from the united states , while the remaining 50 % will be from both the old continent and japan .
the commercial launch of insight is planned for the  |||  early  |||  next year , shortly after the presentation of the model inside the company in january in valenza .
it reaches now 3,90 meters  |||  length  |||  ( five centimetres more ) , 1,69 meters width ( two centimetres more ) and its interaxle 2,50 meters , with an increment of five centimetres .
its 1,52  |||  meters  |||  height , still , remained unchanged .
other improvements - in addition to external elements , such as the rear led or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - concern the improved access to  |||  back  |||  seats .
doors which  |||  allow  |||  access to back seats , open now with an angle of 80 degrees , compared to 67 degrees in the first model .
at the time of marketing , this  |||  small  |||  model will come with a petrol engines of 1.2 or 1.4 litres .
both mechanical systems will include the i - vtec technology which permits a lower fuel consumption , produces less  |||  carbon  |||  dioxide emissions , optimizes the mechanical refinements and , at the same time , maintains high torque engine in all its phases .
the 1.2 litre version reaches a power of 90 hp at 6000 rpm with a  |||  maximum  |||  torque of 114 nm . at 4900 rpm .
the propulsion - which in  |||  previous  |||  jazz reached the 78 hp -- just needs 5.3 litres of fuel and produces around 125 grams of co 2 emissions equivalent .
in developing the technologies for the prevention of accidents , nissan got inspired this time , by  |||  nature  |||  , and especially by bees .
this is the bio - mimetic car robot  |||  drive  |||  , or br 23c , the first step to project technologies for the prevention of collisions .
the engineers of the advanced technical centre of nissan motor co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the centre for scientific research and technology of the prestigious  |||  university  |||  of tokyo in japan .
according to kazuhiro doi ,  |||  general  |||  director of public relations for the technology , research and development of brand management , the br 23c is an expansion of the security shield of the four areas produced by nissan .
this robot is intended to improve the ability to  |||  prevent  |||  collisions in the vehicles produced by the company .
during the flight ,  |||  each  |||  bee creates its own oval personal space that is very similar to the shield of security developed by nissan .
but the most important element is constituted by the bee 's compound eyes , which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle ,  |||  allowing  |||  the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space .
to recreate these visual features , engineers developed what they defined a laser locator ( laser  |||  range  |||  finder ) .
" when detects an obstacle , the little robot imitates the bee 's movements and change direction immediately by turning the wheels at a right or wider angle to  |||  avoid  |||  the collision .
" if it were not so , the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to  |||  avoid  |||  obstacles " explains toshiyuki andoh , director of the laboratory of mobility and chief engineer of this project .
unlike a bee , the robot can not deviate upwards or downwards , or even diagonally . it can only  |||  move  |||  in two dimensions and in the direction its wheels can turn to . obviously , it cannot run infinite directions and ways like bees do .
for this reason , nissan has used a rotation function in addition to the acceleration and deceleration functions , to permit the little robot can  |||  avoid  |||  collisions .
" this device only needs to process new information  |||  every  |||  few seconds , and acting from this data .
it does not require to store any information or to use the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers . for this reason it can go without interruption supplied only by a few dozen kb of  |||  memory  |||  .
this may surprise , but we are not talking of gigabytes or mega of  |||  memory  |||  . "
the robot  |||  uses  |||  lithium - polymer batteries , which are lighter and more durable than the lithium - ion typology .
do shudder  |||  before  |||  applying for a loan
we have to recognize that the  |||  department  |||  of treasury of the united states , owning quite good capitals to act , certainly does not lack of talent .
having to face the crisis and to  |||  prevent  |||  the americans to be cheated with garbage loans by banks under doubts of insolvency , created a fun and educational game for internet users . this is " bad credit hotel " .
in other words , the " hotel of the bad  |||  credits  |||  " ... or of the problems .
the gloom aspect of this hotel and , in  |||  particular  |||  , of its receptionist aims to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times before applying for a loan .
and above all , to think quite carefully about where applying for it . this is probably the game primary  |||  objective  |||  .
it 's much more a web page for teens than a site for the  |||  general public  |||  .
well , a  |||  dream  |||  - room appears inside the hotel .
it is still something , because about buying a  |||  house  |||  ... better to leave it .
a week after unveiling a provisional  |||  agreement  |||  , the two banks have explained that mufg would buy 9.9 % of morgan stanley shares at a price of 25.25 dollars , totalling three billion dollars .
the selling  |||  price  |||  is less than 19 % of the value of the securities on 31 august .
morgan stanley affirmed that the overall operation would be  |||  based  |||  on an average unit price of 29 dollars , or 28 % above its current price .
" this strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of morgan stanley to the status of holding bank , " said john mack , the ceo of the  |||  american  |||  group .
morgan stanley has  |||  adopted  |||  this new status last week , which should enable it to diversify its activities but it has to pass through the authority of the federal reserve .
its alliance with mufg also confirms that the current financial crisis  |||  forced  |||  the biggest names on wall street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before .
the modalities  |||  presented  |||  on monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days : the previous monday , morgan had just announced it would sell up to 20 % of its shares to the japanese for about $ 8.5 billion .
" a week ago , explained toshihide mizuno , executive director of mufg in tokyo , " we  |||  thought  |||  that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares .
but given the current state of the economy and market , we hoped to minimize the  |||  risks  |||  and to protect our backs . "
|||  based  |||  on the weighted average price mufg will pay for its morgan stanley securities 7 % below their book value .
the agreement foresees that mufg may convert annually half of its preferred securities into  |||  ordinary  |||  shares if these traded more than 50 % above the conversion price , about $ 47 for a given period .
morgan stanley assures that the capital provided by mufg will enable it to seize investment opportunities , strengthen its balance sheet and  |||  increase  |||  its liquidity .
a spokesperson for the group , however ,  |||  refused  |||  to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies .
after the  |||  investment  |||  of mufg , morgan stanley forecasts a capital ratio tier one of about 15 % , one of the best in the industry .
morgan said to have " significantly "  |||  reduced  |||  its balance sheet since the end of august .
recent weeks have been  |||  difficult  |||  for the group , which saw half its share price melt away while the insurance costs against the risk of default on its debt soared .
this cost reduced on monday but remained at a new high level ,  |||  around  |||  12 % .
rebuilding  |||  around  |||  the republic of the twenty - first century socialism .
this is the  |||  joint  |||  project of the venezuelan hugo chávez , evo morales of bolivia , and the ecuadorian rafael correa .
this sunday , like its counterparts and friends , it is the  |||  third  |||  to put to a vote a draft for a new constitution .
mission accomplished  |||  since  |||  64 % of voters voted " yes " to referendum , according to official results based on 80 % of the votes .
|||  based  |||  on these results , the " no " got 28 % , 7 % of the votes were invalid , and 0.7 % were blank votes .
for the draft  |||  constitution  |||  to be adopted , it should get half the votes plus one .
sunday , two polls conducted outside the polling stations and one non - governmental organization had announced a large victory for the " yes " , of the  |||  range  |||  between 63 % and 70 % .
the " constitution has triumphed so overwhelmingly , " he  |||  assured  |||  , commending the ecuadorians in the government headquarters in guayaquil , 280 km southwest of quito .
the draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy , by reserving it the " development planning " of a country  |||  living  |||  mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign money that they send to their emigrants .
buoyed by correa ,  |||  elected  |||  in 2006 , the project also provides greater powers to the head of state , which can carry up to two consecutive terms of four years and will be able to dissolve the assembly .
the constitution also consolidates the principle of  |||  free  |||  health services and education that the president has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants , where 50 % of the population lives below the poverty line .
it also foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops , which will terminate the agreement between quito and washington for  |||  using  |||  ecuador as a launch base for u.s. antidrug operations .
an  |||  egyptian  |||  commando squad launched an assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago .
they are in  |||  cairo  |||  .
the eleven european tourists and their eight egyptian escorts  |||  held  |||  captive for ten days in the desert have been returned on monday afternoon unharmed to the egyptian capital .
in the morning , they were released by an  |||  egyptian  |||  commando in chad .
apparently fit , the hostages arrived around 1530 hours aboard a special plane at the  |||  military  |||  base of al-maza , attached to the international airport of cairo .
they were immediately transferred , without being able to  |||  speak  |||  to the press , via helicopter to the hospital in maadi , a residential suburb of cairo , to undergo examinations .
they are in " good health " , and " no ransom was  |||  paid  |||  " to the captors " , declared the egyptian minister for tourism , zoheir garanna , on the tarmac .
captured on september 19 during a safari in a 4x4 at the foot of mount ouanat at borders with egypt , sudan and libya , this group of hostages had been tossed around from one hideout to  |||  another  |||  by 35 unknown kidnappers .
an egyptian security official said that 30  |||  members  |||  of the special forces , carried aboard two helicopters , had launched the assault during the night just before dawn .
he said that 150 members of the egyptian special forces " rapid response " unit have been sent to sudan as a whole , where they received  |||  support  |||  from german and italian commandos .
the head of the italian diplomatic corps franco frattini in belgrade where he currently is , mentioned the role  |||  played  |||  by italian secret agents and elements of the special forces .
" we must recognize that we have achieved this  |||  result  |||  through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services , from the special forces , " he said , without further details .
he also  |||  denied  |||  paying a ransom .
the day before , the sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 patrol vehicle on  |||  board  |||  of which were the captors , killing six , including the chadian head , and arresting two .
letters - the silent  |||  majority  |||  of culture
a  |||  debate  |||  on the financing of culture made the headlines and has engrossed this electoral campaign .
who will come forward to denounce the misery that is granted to small museums , archives , archaeological or  |||  national  |||  historical sites which are starving for funding ?
which politician dares to remind the federal  |||  government  |||  that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings ?
in quebec , in canada , we have no real  |||  laws  |||  that effectively preserve our heritage ?
did you know that the  |||  french  |||  government devotes three and a half million euro just for the restoration of the castle of chinon in the loire valley ?
they often are the watchdogs of our heritage , who protest with the energy of despair when developers and constructors launch their bulldozers against our old buildings and our  |||  forgotten  |||  cemeteries .
when will there be a forum for  |||  history  |||  and heritage ?
fortis  |||  bank  |||  partially nationalized by benelux governments
benelux states help fortis , the belgian -  |||  dutch  |||  bank - which is the first european financial institute in trouble due to the follow - through effect of the american lending crisis - by a partial state buyout . the three countries have agreed to inject eur 11.2 billion into the banking and insurance company having hungarian interests .
at the end of this week , the belgian , the luxembourg and the  |||  dutch  |||  governments consulted on this issue at the highest level , involving the president of the european central bank and the competition commissioner of the european commission .
under the decision made on sunday night ,  |||  each  |||  government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
the bank will certainly sell some part of its stakes , especially the insurance activities , which it purchased from the  |||  dutch  |||  abn amro last year .
fortis shares started to plunge deeply last week , then in the second part of the week signs of a  |||  serious  |||  crisis appeared at the company .
the shares of the bank  |||  fell  |||  by 12 % on friday , which is the record lowest level for 14 years .
the value of the  |||  shares  |||  has been dropped by two thirds since january .
|||  considering  |||  the current stock prices , the entire market capital value of the group is around eur 14 billion . however , company directors say this does not reflect reality .
the management blames the uncertainties overseas - which are  |||  linked  |||  to accepting the american package of usd 700 billion - for the fall of fortis shares .
filip dierckx was appointed the new chief executive officer of the  |||  bank  |||  on friday .
the financial institute was also seeking private buyers but no substantive  |||  offer  |||  has been made so far .
no panic has emerged so far among the  |||  customers  |||  of the bank ; no bank rush has taken place .
fortis has an own banking establishment in hungary and has bought out leasing  |||  companies  |||  , too .
the  |||  american  |||  life and health insurance companies often refuse to sell insurance to some citizens , due to their drug purchase data .
data protection experts are afraid that the data market  |||  becomes  |||  uncontrollable .
" there is a data protection programme that requires the permission of the person  |||  concerned  |||  in order to use the drug prescription data .
it should be independent , otherwise the fox will be guarding the hen - house " , the washington post quotes richard dick , developer of the programme applicable for tracking  |||  drug  |||  prescriptions .
insurance companies decide on the insurance fee and the amount to be  |||  paid  |||  in case of damages depending on the health condition of the applying customer , and if they consider it too risky , they do not provide insurance .
dick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago : on the basis of the customer 's identification  |||  number  |||  the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 18 months can be easily detected , thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condition .
for instance , the case of regularly buying big doses of cholesterol - reducing drugs practically refers to the fact that the customer has untreatably  |||  high  |||  blood fat level , as a result of which this person would immediately be put to a higher risk category .
the programme has various versions in trade , some of them even defines the risk factor , thus the insurance company has nothing else to do but the paperwork , though smaller  |||  difficulties  |||  arise .
one of the disadvantages is the fact that some  |||  drugs  |||  can be used for several purposes , for example some medical formula are to treat migraine , heat waves or even depression .
the latter one is a significant risk -  |||  increasing  |||  factor from the view of business insurers , while the other two are not .
they are already obliged to do so ,  |||  though  |||  their previous failures have not been penalized .
some companies process even the results of laboratory examinations and connect those to drug consumption data . this way they can  |||  provide  |||  more accurate information on the patients ' health condition .
more and more companies gain access to the data and , in parallel , the control of their use become increasingly  |||  difficult  |||  .
there is a  |||  specific  |||  act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care providers and insurance companies .
the bill on providing inspection  |||  power  |||  for the authorities over companies dealing with data provision has been submitted to the congress .
|||  global  |||  marseille menu
|||  european  |||  union and india doubles trade
as the european union and india are  |||  leading  |||  trade partners of each other , the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue in addition to other , mainly global , problems .
today a france - india summit is going to be  |||  held  |||  , too , particularly about nuclear power co - operation .
though the european union recognizes that india is an emerging democratic world - power , which should be  |||  granted  |||  more say in international affairs , the member states have not been able to come to an agreement yet whether to support the permanent membership of new delhi in un security council or not .
thus this  |||  matter  |||  was not forced during the ninth summit , organized in marseille yesterday .
french president nicolas sarkozy as rotating president of the union , committee president josé manuel barroso and foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed indian prime minister manmohan singh and  |||  agreed  |||  to double , i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros , the trade flow in 5 years .
since  |||  exchange  |||  of goods raised from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007 , this is not an overly ambitious objective .
accordingly , 26 existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with india have been legally harmonized , meaning that air  |||  traffic  |||  can wing in the future .
india aims to sign the  |||  free  |||  trade agreement with the union until the end of 2009 .
sarkozy  |||  promised  |||  to accelerate harmonizing .
the summit concentrated on global  |||  issues  |||  :
on the situation in afghanistan and pakistan as well as on terrorism . the latter was condemned in  |||  every  |||  form by both parties and convening the un conference was urged .
the completion of doha trade round was also expedited ,  |||  although  |||  both parties are responsible for the fiasco so far .
india agreed with this as well as with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate conference which is due  |||  next  |||  year and to decrease greenhouse gas emission by 50 percent until 2050 .
another goal was to  |||  prevent  |||  the growth of food prices and a call for an international conference to review financial crisis was supported .
the indian prime minister is going to a bilateral meeting in the french capital today , where he intends to come to an agreement on the  |||  peaceful  |||  use of nuclear power .
paris expects french companies to be awarded contracts to  |||  build  |||  nuclear reactors in india in a value of 20 billion euros .
according to  |||  news  |||  agency information , the agreement would be in force for 15 years .
over three hundred  |||  italian  |||  editors in frankfurt
more than three hundred will be the  |||  italian  |||  editors present at the sixtieth anniversary of buchmesse , the most important international event for the exchange of copyrights .
francesco maria giro , the undersecretary for cultural heritage and activities ministry will  |||  represent  |||  the italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the italian pavilion : in fact italy will be present as an institution with an italian stand -- 264 metres squared of exhibition space .
according to the data , there is a progressively diminishing importance of books by foreign authors in italian production , and in  |||  particular  |||  in that for adults and children .
found the aeroplane of steve fossett the millionaire  |||  disappeared  |||  a year ago
the wreckage has been found on a plateau at 3000 metres altitude , in the sierra nevada area of mammoth lakes , at the  |||  border  |||  between california and nevada .
the madera county sheriff , john anderson , has dispelled any remaining doubts : " the aeroplane has been located , we have  |||  sent  |||  a team , and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which steve follett was flying the day he disappeared " he said in a press conference .
afterwards , the sheriff pointed out that no human remains have been found either on the plane , nor in the  |||  surrounding  |||  area .
the millionaire , 63 years old , was given up for  |||  dead  |||  in february .
the american national transport safety bureau ( ntsb ) has reported that some hours after the wreck was spotted an investigatory team was  |||  sent  |||  , that has then identified the aircraft : it is the bellanca 8kcab , which has been missing since 3rd september 2007 , when fossett took off from yerington in nevada for a three hour flight .
the items are two documents in the name of fossett , both issued by the federal aviation  |||  administration  |||  of illinois , some cash , and a sweatshirt .
the millionaire had gained himself a place in  |||  history  |||  thanks to a series of world records .
in 2002 , at his sixth attempt , he became the first man to complete the round the world trip in a hot air balloon : a two - week solo  |||  flight  |||  .
|||  three  |||  years later he did the round the world trip by plane without landing .
among his many  |||  records  |||  , there is also flying at 15,445 metres , above the andes , but with a co - pilot .
glk , the  |||  advertising  |||  that does not await you
in  |||  short  |||  , this is glk , the latest addition to the " compact " off - road vehicles from the starred manufacturer , with which mercedes - benz has tried to let in a breath of fresh air into this sector .
|||  right  |||  because its features are out of the traditional norms , the message accompanying the launch of the glk suv will also be unexpected and unconventional , it will be available in mercedes - benz showrooms as from next october 17th .
so the publicity campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will set off a new communication  |||  method  |||  which also includes a futuristic campaign of 3d billboards , used for the first time in italy by a car brand .
a project of large billboards , set in motion in three  |||  different  |||  phases , which will dominate the most central milanese shopping street , corso como , until the 15th november .
in fact , looking at the  |||  image  |||  one will get the sensation that the car protrudes out of the poster .
subsequently , through the use of the innovative technology elumina 8 all the details of the new glk will be illuminated at various times , and then be recomposed as a  |||  single  |||  image .
without any doubts , mercedes , through this advertisement , is  |||  trying  |||  to introduce something new into the conventional field of automotive publicity .
will it succeed with this formula to provoke the  |||  interest  |||  of future buyers ? we will see .
here is who the  |||  italian  |||  hooligans are
but who are those 150-200 people of  |||  whom  |||  italy is now ashamed ? they form part of the group " ultras italia " who for years has been supporting the national football team and till now , truth be known , has never created major problems .
neither has it  |||  ever  |||  clashed with opposing fans .
from verona , padua ,  |||  trieste  |||  , and udine .
they take up their ideas from english  |||  fans  |||  .
the figc had put at the disposal of the italian fans 144 tickets for the  |||  match  |||  : all personal , hence easily checkable .
four italian supporters , who had  |||  previous  |||  stadium - related crimes , had in fact been refused tickets and kept from going .
now the ministry of the interior is waiting to be able to read the official records , which should arrive from the bulgarian police before taking steps : in this instance , it is possible to ban for five years at least the supporters that have been arrested or those that have been  |||  identified  |||  during the disturbances .
an international banishment which prohibits the attendance of not only stadiums in italy but also in all of  |||  europe  |||  .
" we have to immediately put out this conflagration and not legitimise those that behave in this  |||  fashion  |||  " , assert those at the ministry in viminale .
so , " eyes wide  |||  open  |||  especially since there is the national team playing on wednesday at lecce " .
tomorrow the observatory meets , on tuesday the casms which can count on a section of the aise , that is the  |||  secret  |||  service , which handles exactly the problems in stadiums .
" the chorus duce - duce and the arm stretched out during the mameli anthem ? in bulgaria it 's not a  |||  crime  |||  ... " .
these are the thoughts (  |||  expressed  |||  with great disappointment ) of domenico mazzilli , who , as of a few weeks ago , is the director of the observatory of the viminale ( he achieved the post which was initially held by francesco tagliente and then by felice ferlizzi ) .
it 's  |||  true  |||  , says mazzilli , that in bulgaria it is not a crime to chant hymns to the duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been disgraceful .
" i am not a sociologist -  |||  adds  |||  the n. 1 of the observatory -- the crime should be imputed in the country where the incident occurs .
|||  food  |||  : where european inflation slipped up
the skyward zoom in  |||  food  |||  prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation .
|||  official  |||  forecasts predicted just 3 percent , bloomberg said .
according to one analyst , ecb has been caught in a catch - 22 : it  |||  needs  |||  to " talk down " inflation , to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game .
germany 's november inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a  |||  record  |||  ; in spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6 .
soaring  |||  food  |||  and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere .
consumers also have had to pay significantly more for vegetable oils and  |||  dairy  |||  products in 2007 .
the world market price of crude oil shot up by 52 percent this year , with the black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel  |||  last  |||  month .
analysts see the 12 - month inflation rate as holding steady at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months , but say that the annual average  |||  rate  |||  will be 2.1 percent .
they also predict that the ecb will cut  |||  interest  |||  rates twice during the course of 2008 .
fidesz support shot up significantly in  |||  early  |||  december after a lengthy period of just holding its own . this gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002 , while gallup reports support for the socialists at an all - time low of 13 percent .
the poll puts mdf and szdsz numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament ; garnering about 2 percent  |||  support  |||  each within the entire sample .
for next year , over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an  |||  improvement  |||  .
thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted ferenc gyurcsány , while 38 percent put their trust in viktor  |||  orbán  |||  .
fifty - four percent said they did not trust the pm , while 27 percent said they mistrusted the fidesz  |||  chairman  |||  .
one gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who  |||  believe  |||  that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office .
when queried about interest in a referendum , 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one , while  |||  another  |||  20 percent said it most likely would go to the polls .
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees , 79 percent to scrap co - payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem  |||  hospital  |||  charges .
auchan prices are highest , tesco 's are up by  |||  almost  |||  20 percent
|||  article  |||  from napi gazdaság
prices in napi 's usual christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the budaörs shopping triangle , with  |||  each  |||  of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints .
since supermarket prices went through the roof last december , the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage - wise , when compared to that high  |||  base  |||  .
nonetheless , it has to be a shock to  |||  consumers  |||  to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago .
napi 's basket exceeded the psychological huf 10,000  |||  limit  |||  by a minimum of huf 91 at the giant supermarkets tested .
the most expensive basket  |||  cost  |||  us 10 573 forints .
the  |||  price  |||  of unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year 's level , but boneless turkey breast , walnuts , and poppy seeds were up significantly .
we found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official statistics office data ,  |||  though  |||  we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at auchan .
the competition factor was not enough to push the  |||  product  |||  's price down to under 200 forints .
another surprise in this  |||  store  |||  was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two - litre bottle of coca - cola in a bottle with a deposit on it , so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints .
|||  nevertheless  |||  , this year napi 's basket cost the most at auchan and the least at cora .
we worked the numbers and found that napi 's basket cost 15 percent more than  |||  last  |||  christmas at cora , while it was 18 percent more expensive at both tesco and auchan .
in forints , the average  |||  increase  |||  was 1,480 .
and this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector . the supermarkets were obviously  |||  unable  |||  to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products , finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption .
( if the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product , it stands to take a  |||  major  |||  hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity . )
last year , with the vat hike the price  |||  increase  |||  in napi 's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level , while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive .
( this is not quite in line with official statistics office data : its figures show price  |||  increases  |||  of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs
including both flour and  |||  eggs  |||  . )
we found that most shoppers in the  |||  three  |||  outlets visited were not really interested in prices .
hospital cleanliness , overcrowding , and overburdened  |||  staff  |||  are not conducive to halting infections , said the division chief at the national centre for epidemiology .
many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to  |||  save  |||  money .
an mrsa - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus -  |||  infection  |||  was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of jános hospital .
the patient was  |||  isolated  |||  .
the same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection  |||  early  |||  this year .
it had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident . shortly afterward , it had to re - admit the patient because of an mrsa infection , and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be  |||  vital  |||  to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph .
this year , up to 10th of december , hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections  |||  caused  |||  by antibiotic - resistant pathogens to the national nosocomial surveillance system , said national centre for epidemiology physician - in - chief karolina böröcz .
one - third of all people carry the staphylococcus aureus ( sa ) bacteria in their noses without it ever  |||  causing  |||  an infection .
however , if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used , the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic - resistant variety , which spreads  |||  rapidly  |||  in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax .
particularly at risk are elderly and low - body - weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised . among these patients , the staph can  |||  cause  |||  serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis .
according to jános hospital 's  |||  medical  |||  director , there is nothing unusual about having an mrsa infection since they are part of everyday hospital life .
the  |||  vast  |||  majority of nosocomial mrsa - induced infections could be prevented said böröcz . however , she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic - resistant infections .
since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes , hospitals should routinely  |||  check  |||  all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate mrsa carriers .
but , taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in  |||  hungarian  |||  hospitals .
one reason is that the  |||  national  |||  health insurance fund does not cover the costs of these tests .
in most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed  |||  unless  |||  the patient has an obvious mrsa infection , said the national centre for epidemiology physician - in - chief .
the european union has stringent protocols on the  |||  appropriate  |||  use of antibiotics in human medicine and hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies .
the goal should be targeted therapy , meaning that microbiology tests should be  |||  conducted  |||  to prevent resistance from evolving , but hospitals do not always keep to this .
therefore , washing hands , and wearing gloves and masks play a  |||  significant  |||  role in prevention , but here again , we find many shortcomings in hospital practices .
in fact , hospital wards are often overcrowded , with beds too  |||  close  |||  to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements .
sadly , we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to  |||  save  |||  on disinfectants , said böröcz , adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients , chances of infection increase .
|||  government  |||  programme to combat mrsa
|||  treating  |||  mrsa infections costs the health insurer huge amounts of money , so efforts should be made everywhere to keep them from occurring in the first place .
in the uk for example , the government has a  |||  programme  |||  in place to cut back mrsa and prevent its spread .
the programme appears to be successful for  |||  published  |||  data shows that mrsa is on the decline in the uk.
the european centre for disease prevention and  |||  control  |||  ( ecdc ) has set prevention of the evolvement of multi - resistant pathogens ( including mrsa ) and of nosocomial infections as a priority project .
police chief  |||  causing  |||  fatal accident was not drunk
an official professional opinion has been submitted regarding a fatal accident  |||  caused  |||  by budapest 's district 22 police chief .
attila morvai , spokesman for the budapest municipal prosecutor 's office , issued a statement on friday , on receipt of the professional opinion . the opinion unequivocally concludes that the district 22 police chief , who has resigned , could not have been under the influence of alcohol or any other  |||  substance  |||  when he hit and fatally injured a pedestrian on tuesday .
the pedestrian  |||  died  |||  shortly after arrival at a hospital .
the district police chief resigned because of the accident and  |||  requested  |||  that he be retired from the force because , said a police communique , he was so shaken by the event .
the former  |||  police  |||  chief has been cooperating fully with the prosecutors investigating the case , morvai added .
|||  additional  |||  400 million euros available for infrastructure
four hundred million euros in loans will become available for education , transportation , the  |||  environmental  |||  infrastructure and energy development in the wake of three accords signed by finance minister jános veres and european investment bank ( eib ) vice - president marta gajecka , in budapest on friday .
eib approved a framework package of 300 million euros in 2006 to help the hungarian budget finance transportation and environmental projects being  |||  implemented  |||  by the cohesion fund . a concrete agreement for 100 million from the package was signed earlier , so one new contract covers use of the remaining 200 million euros .
the second agreement , for 150 million euros , will help the budget  |||  finance  |||  education - related projects .
the third agreement was for 50 million euros to be used for innovation . the central  |||  budget  |||  plans to incorporate it primarily into a r&d project at debrecen university .
they  |||  agreed  |||  that when hungary finalizes metro financing details with the eu , they would revisit the original contracts to see whether they needed to be amended , and if so , how .
veres said he believed that latter discussion would take place in the first  |||  quarter  |||  of 2008 .
eib has provided hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros  |||  since  |||  1990 , which were used to finance 113 projects .
eib is linking interest rates on the  |||  loans  |||  to the euribor . it is allowing an 8 year grace period , and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability .
the real estate market in bulgaria has been  |||  developing  |||  at an unbelievable rate - all of europe has its eyes on this heretofore rarely heard - of balkan nation .
who is  |||  buying  |||  what and where on this market , which is still the cheapest in the eu despite rapidly rising prices ?
this analysis comes from re / max 's  |||  bulgarian  |||  division .
no question but that bulgaria is the most sought - after east european real estate target , with its low - cost ski chalets and oceanfront  |||  homes  |||  .
according to re / max bulgaria analysts , sooner or later , the central portion of the country will begin attracting investors . so a growing number of people are already  |||  buying  |||  properties in veliko tarnovo , gabrovo , elena , tryavna - , and more and more investors are looking around the rousse area , which is expressly cheap at the moment .
sofia , the capital , also has many attractive opportunities . commercial and office  |||  space  |||  offers the highest returns .
forward - thinking investors are already making  |||  major  |||  purchases , for instance , in and around bansko .
analysts  |||  suggest  |||  that people who buy real estate in bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles .
maltese and cypriot investors have also gained a foothold , while russians are traditional big - time buyers at the  |||  black  |||  sea and along top ski slopes .
there are three types of international  |||  buyers  |||  , said regional manager of re / max bulgaria georgi yankov .
the ones who plan to resettle in bulgaria either  |||  purchase  |||  renovated properties for prices ranging from 50,000 euros to 100,000 , or old fixer - uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves .
they want their purchases to be easy to access , and to be equipped for modern communication . it is important that they be in a big city , with  |||  shopping  |||  and , generally , a local doctor nearby .
real estate prices in sofia , the capital , are rising steadily , as is  |||  demand  |||  .
while bulgaria boasts the european union 's lowest real estate prices , they have still gone up by 21 percent in the  |||  past  |||  five years .
environmin and hungary 's six  |||  percent  |||
|||  professionals  |||  and politicians from 192 countries are slated to discuss the bali roadmap that focuses on efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
the  |||  united  |||  states has let it be known that it is unwilling to negotiate precise numbers although it is not opposed to agreeing to a 25-40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 when compared to 1990 .
the other big question at the conference is whether the developed nations are ready not only to reduce their emissions but also to  |||  offer  |||  financial and technological assistance to countries that need it .
hungary 's six  |||  percent  |||
fodor  |||  noted  |||  that the eu has its sights on a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 , whether the " post - 2012 agreement " is reached or not , and is ready to cut them by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the globe and developing nations are also ready to accept obligations to the extent of their abilities and responsibilities .
hungary agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-1987 , a goal it intends to  |||  meet  |||  , said the environment ministry 's press release .
the result could be a  |||  delay  |||  in emissions reduction , which would put earth on a certain course towards an average temperature rise exceeding 2 degrees celsius . should that happen , scientists say the consequences would be dire and irreversible .
uk uses youtube as military  |||  recruiting  |||  tool
british  |||  military  |||  units have been sharing their iraqi and afghanistani actions through video clips on you tube in an effort to popularize their missions .
the royal air  |||  force  |||  ( raf ) was the first to develop a taste for youtube : its special forces in afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the taliban since march 2006 , bbc reports .
fully 139 raf images have been uploaded onto the  |||  internet  |||  and so far over they have received over 75,000 hits .
the uk defence ministry has been registered since spring 2007 as " defence headquarters " , regularly uploading video clips on iraqi and afghanistani  |||  actions  |||  , while the commonwealth office and the multinational force - iraq ( mnf - i ) have their own you tube channels .
the raf originally uploaded the videos as a recruitment tool . the defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the  |||  real  |||  purpose of keeping the forces abroad .
publicity disseminated through this avenue costs almost nothing when compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television , defence expert gordon mackenzie told bbc . at the same time , they inadvertently carry a bit of a political message for , in a special way , they offer insight into the reasons why the government ordered the ongoing military  |||  actions  |||  .
a problem the military has to contend with involves the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips , which sometimes even show dying soldiers . in the slightly hypocritical " official " clips , officers will at most talk about their losses but the bloody side of the  |||  fighting  |||  is never actually shown .
quite a  |||  number  |||  of videos from the iraqi and afghanistani battlefields showing live action have been posted on the internet , but british forces have only recently joined in the postings .
american recruitment is a bit different . the us has been  |||  using  |||  america 's army , a tactical shooting game available for free download , as a recruiting tool . in it players become soldiers in a more - or - less realistic simulation of fighting forces .
other ministries plan parties with live bands , while still  |||  others  |||  are giving out raffle tickets and a glass or two of christmas spirits to enhance the mood and find a way into the hearts of staff .
celebrations , christmas spirit , concerts and smorgasbord - how the  |||  powerful  |||  party .
this year the defence ministry is planning the biggest ministry  |||  christmas  |||  party , but the guests wo n't be ministry staffers .
the national development agency ( nfü ) and the ministry of  |||  economics  |||  and transport ( gkm ) are kicking up their heels and partying more ardently than the other government offices .
gkm is holding its party at the house of the future , and spending huf 4,320,000 on the package for about 350 of its 600  |||  staff  |||  members .
nfü spent 4,700,000 forints on its christmas cheer , holding its celebration at the headquarters of the  |||  national  |||  justice administration council ( oit ) on wednesday . it is offering guests a series of concert performances and dinner .
the hall rental cost one million forints , and the rest  |||  went  |||  on the more than four hundred invited guests .
we have been told that one division within nfü has been  |||  invited  |||  to another christmas party , too : a bid management company , the hungarian economic development centre ( mag zrt ) , will be celebrating with eu money .
it rented out the entire vígszínház  |||  theatre  |||  for the event .
oit headquarters played host not only to nfü but also to the justice and law enforcement ministry , which decided to hold a lucia day ball on december 7 , instead of a  |||  christmas  |||  party .
about 500 people  |||  attended  |||  the ball .
the party got underway with a toast by the  |||  minister  |||  , and after the dinner there was dancing to live music .
when questioned [ by origo ] they said that formal dress was not  |||  mandatory  |||  for either women or men .
the ministries of health , labour and local  |||  government  |||  organized more puritan dances .
the health ministry ran a  |||  celebration  |||  for its staff at its own headquarters , spending 400,000 forints on the event .
local government minister gordon bajnai plans only to drink a  |||  simple  |||  toast with staff in the assembly hall of the ministry for local government and regional development .
the finance ministry ( pm ) is holding a christmas gathering in its own assembly hall and has invited 436  |||  staff  |||  members .
it plans to spend huf 2,500 per guest for the christmas party , which will  |||  include  |||  a smorgasbord buffet and one toast per person .
pm workers have welcomed christmas in this fashion  |||  every  |||  year since jános veres became minister .
people do n't actually plan to party - the mood will remain official , thanks partly to the  |||  minister  |||  who intends to make a speech , and partly to the timing - it will be in the afternoon .
the  |||  farm  |||  ministry is holding off for a new year 's reception , which will be on january 20 , so there wo n't be any christmas celebration .
its  |||  reception  |||  will be at a vajdahunyad castle in the city park , and the ministry reported that it plans to spend 1,000 forints per guest , for 100 guests .
the media department underlined that it was offering a very  |||  simple  |||  buffet meal , to which it was inviting only the professional diplomats accredited to hungary .
the reception , a repeat of one held annually for some time now , will again begin with a  |||  brief  |||  greeting from the minister and end with just a bit of snacking .
the environment ministry was  |||  unable  |||  to tell us the cost of its office christmas .
forces for a  |||  huge  |||  strike come together
on friday , the liga unions and the  |||  national  |||  federation of workers ' councils ( mosz ) will put together a strike committee charged with coordinating an open - ended strike set to start on monday .
they plan to hold a  |||  protest  |||  rally on saturday and on monday - the day parliament is scheduled to vote a health insurance bill into law - they will begin their work stoppage .
the strike is certain to snarl the transport network , for rail traffic will come to a more or less  |||  complete  |||  halt and budapest public transport will be frozen until 1.00 p.m. .
liga and the workers ' council federation will publicize details of their jointly  |||  organized  |||  monday walkout on friday afternoon .
organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on saturday , and the organizations joining the  |||  strike  |||  will begin an open - ended work stoppage on monday unless they can come to prior agreement with the government .
if by some chance parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law , the unions will immediately retract their strike  |||  appeal  |||  .
if they adopt the bill , the strike committees will meet and decide on their  |||  next  |||  moves .
given parliament 's agenda for monday , it is conceivable that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly not until  |||  late  |||  at night .
many unions and civic organizations have responded to the  |||  strike  |||  appeal . a complete and regularly updated list of them is available on liga 's website .
some organizations have announced open - ended strikes , while  |||  others  |||  are limiting themselves to temporary work stoppages .
the national federation of physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours while the democratic union of healthcare and  |||  welfare  |||  workers ( eddsz ) , a part of the umbrella union cooperation forum ( szef ) , plans a two - hour warning strike .
the most important of liga 's four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for society - wide  |||  debate  |||  .
the second  |||  demand  |||  is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually instead of all at once .
the third is that when determining the occupations eligible for  |||  early  |||  retirement , the jobs to be included in the option be chosen before 2010 .
political capital : the hungarian guard has heightened the country 's  |||  risk  |||  level
actions by the hungarian guard ,  |||  established  |||  in august with the support of the movement for a righter hungary , has raised the political risk level of hungary and the entire region from a number of aspects , according to the risk analysing division of political capital .
the research entity issued a " risk warning , " writing : the actions of the hungarian guard are triggering an exceeding political risk " that the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non - gypsy residents of hungary could heat up to toxic levels as  |||  early  |||  as the short - term , leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent . "
the major reason for this is that hungarian guard 's political strategy appears to be aimed at provoking  |||  action  |||  of this nature , the research institute added .
in addition , the research institute believes that the extensive domestic and international media attention to hungarian guard  |||  actions  |||  has " significantly damaged hungary 's international image , particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and in the sophistication of its democracy . "
" the common feature of these groups is that they call themselves civic organizations while openly declaring that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks ( citing disaster management , national  |||  defence  |||  , law enforcement ) while declaring that the police and armed forces , in other words , the government , is unsuited for the role , " political capital adds .
in other words , their emphasis on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruses to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts , but are also part of a  |||  political  |||  strategy .
according to the analysis , the activity of the hungarian guard is heightening the  |||  risk  |||  of damaging our relations with our neighbours , too .
all of these factors influence the  |||  political  |||  stability of the region , " it adds .
the research institute notes that the establishment of the hungarian guard is not a  |||  unique  |||  phenomenon in central and eastern europe , and as such it heightens the political risk for the whole of the region .
it notes that the operation of the hungarian guard is similar to that of the bulgarian national guard ,  |||  established  |||  in august 2007 by the far right bulgarian national union . ( bnu ) .
serious conflicts that broke out between roma and non - roma in a sofia district ( krasna polyana ) were behind the establishment of the  |||  bulgarian  |||  guard .
bnu took advantage of the disturbances to  |||  establish  |||  its guard , claiming that the goal of the organization was " national self - defence . "
the initiative triggered heated  |||  debate  |||  among the bulgarian public , it added .
one sign that the risk of ethnic conflict has  |||  increased  |||  , the analysts wrote , is that some roma organizations in bulgaria have announced plans to establish a guard of their own as a resistance force .
since the hungarian guard has so far acted quite similarly to the bulgarian  |||  national  |||  guard , it is quite possible that the roma community of hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self - defence , wrote political capital in warning of the risk .
political capital research manager attila juhász responded to a query from the mti hungarian wire service by saying that  |||  risk  |||  analysis was one of the research institute 's chief activities .
|||  each  |||  year , he said , they publish risk analyses , and if they discover any factor that might alter risks , they notify public opinion by publishing a risk warning , as they have now done .
hungarian law names the red - letter days specifically , and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a  |||  general  |||  practice , although next year we will not see quite so much reorganization .
|||  holidays  |||  are not uniform in the eu or the usa either .
the hungarian legal system distinguishes among  |||  national  |||  holidays , state / bank holidays , and non - working days .
non - working days are for the most part religious holidays and anniversaries of  |||  significant  |||  historical events .
hungary celebrates new year 's eve and day : the  |||  final  |||  day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both non - working days - the latter if for no other reason , then to recover from new year 's eve festivities .
there are a  |||  total  |||  of eleven red - letter days in each calendar year .
march 15 is a  |||  national  |||  holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 while october 23 commemorates the revolution of 1956 .
august 20 marks the founding of the  |||  nation  |||  , while may day is labour day . on november 1 and 2 we commemorate the dead , remembering our friends and relatives who have left us .
since our state , national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend , it has become customary to reorganize the working week when there is only a  |||  single  |||  workday between the holiday and the weekend .
the long weekend comes with a price however , which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding saturday at work or in  |||  school  |||  .
for many years , the  |||  minister  |||  of labour has issued decrees naming the days on which we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and the weekend .
the decree covers all employers and all  |||  workers  |||  they employ , as well as civil servants and public employees .
it does not cover staff in facilities , businesses or institutions that regularly  |||  operate  |||  round - the - clock , and where staff works 24/7 .
|||  next  |||  year most holidays will come during mid - week , so where will be less manipulation of the calendar than this year .
the first re - organization of the  |||  working  |||  week will occur to accommodate may day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off .
|||  saturday  |||  , april 26 will be a workday , and in exchange , friday , may 2 will be a day off .
the working week will be turned about again around the  |||  october  |||  23 holiday . saturday , october 18 will be a workday so that people may have friday , october 24 off .
the end of the year , however , will be wall - to - wall holidays , with most people enjoying time off from december 24 through the new year , even  |||  though  |||  new year 's eve falls on a wednesday .
six little things you can annoy your  |||  colleagues  |||  with
the e-mails we forget to  |||  send  |||  , the voice - mail messages we never get , the white lies we tell and no longer even notice - they can all colour day - to - day life on the job .
the question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately  |||  avoid  |||  dubious situations that can irritate others .
" oops , sorry . i forgot to tell you that  |||  marketing  |||  was looking for you , " says one of your colleagues .
in a best case scenario , he or she will apologize and try to mend things . he or she might even phone marketing to explain about the forgotten  |||  message  |||  ( this scenario is quite rare ) .
do you borrow  |||  things  |||  that do n't belong to you ?
nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document , piece of office equipment or  |||  telephone  |||  which turns out not to be there .
perhaps you see the pen you thought you  |||  lost  |||  lying on your colleague 's desk .
do n't take anything away from a colleague 's desk without asking . they have every  |||  right  |||  to be angry if you make off with their belongings .
do not pocket office envelopes or post - it notes . it can be very irritating if they run out prematurely , especially if you 're the one who  |||  needs  |||  one immediately .
do you gossip about your colleagues '  |||  private  |||  lives ?
there is no good way to  |||  halt  |||  gossip that has already begun to spread .
who is doing what with  |||  whom  |||  ?
if someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you , do not abuse that  |||  trust  |||  !
keep what you  |||  hear  |||  to yourself . when a colleague is out , do not discuss his or her private life with others , even if they also know what the person has been up to .
if you know beforehand that you are not going to be in , or if something happens that forces you to stay  |||  home  |||  for a day , let your colleagues and supervisor know in advance . do n't surprise them by not showing up .
all of these things can be irritating , even if people are not concentrating on a project (  |||  writing  |||  , planning or organizing something ) at that very moment .
do you blame  |||  others  |||  for your mistakes ?
if something is n't ready by deadline , if you forgot to  |||  send  |||  out an important letter or pass on a message , do not blame others for your forgetfulness !
is the office too much like a second  |||  home  |||  ?
track suit and slippers : quite comfortable when you 're at  |||  home  |||  , but they are not office wear !
do not dress for  |||  leisure  |||  at the office , even if your job allows it !
do not be sloppy . show respect for your  |||  colleagues  |||  and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to go to work .
i 'm creeping along in the car in the  |||  usual  |||  morning traffic jam .
the radio starts playing an unusual tune : it 's a violin  |||  sound  |||  with special electronic effects .
the music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments . then , like a  |||  true  |||  jewel , a female choir steps in .
the domestic music world has n't spoiled us with  |||  high quality  |||  electronic pop in a long time .
but now , all of a sudden you can  |||  look  |||  at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new zagar cd .
the appearance of yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture . although guitar - pinging garage rock is  |||  back  |||  in style , domestic electropop is ready to prove that there is something new under the sun.
his project ( zagar ) and his  |||  music  |||  , an alloy of jazz , electronic dance music , and pop began pushing upward into the public ear when he was suddenly asked to compose soundtracks for films ( such as
the group  |||  responded  |||  with a new and even better cd .
we would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones , homage to the spirit of the  |||  times  |||  .
györgy ligeti , who sings in britain with the  |||  puzzle  |||  , made his intro with these tunes , when the disc was premiered at the millenáris .
so ,  |||  everything  |||  's okay . or is it ?
hvg . hu : the question this new hit song raises is just how culty your music has  |||  remained  |||  ?
i think there are two light music castes ; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop , but commerce and  |||  honest  |||  .
so - called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the  |||  sole  |||  purpose of boosting sales , which puts it in the commerce category .
while a good pop song can be sparked by  |||  honest  |||  motives .
the attitudes of the recipients  |||  operate  |||  in that spirit , irrespectively of language and national boundaries .
hvg . hu : do you see any difference in the receptivity of domestic and international audiences as far as your  |||  music  |||  goes ?
b. zs . :  |||  light  |||  music has more tradition abroad , especially west of here .
over there , older people also come to  |||  concerts  |||  , not just teens and twenty - somethings .
they pay far more attention to changes in the genre because they  |||  consider  |||  it a part of contemporary culture .
hvg . hu : what role does the  |||  audience  |||  play in your work ?
b. zs . : of course it  |||  feels  |||  good to see more and more people at our concerts .
but we have never designed our  |||  music  |||  for the market .
the role of the audience comes out at the concerts when the effects are contagious , but even that comes from the intangible changes triggered by the  |||  moment  |||  .
i have actually noticed that the  |||  moment  |||  you decide that you want to meet audience expectations , you cease to be interesting .
hvg . hu : to what extent do you plan to  |||  follow  |||  yonderboi 's example ?
he 's a soloist and has  |||  built  |||  a career west of where we are .
in the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to yonderboi since several of us split from that group , though we chose a  |||  different  |||  road .
many folks first heard the  |||  name  |||  zagar with this number .
b. zs . : we never  |||  planned  |||  to have a hit to boost cd sales .
we  |||  intended  |||  it to wrap up the album , to try to lighten up the orgy of tone and the tougher themes earlier in the cd .
why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding  |||  principle  |||  ?
that gave us the six - voice choir - of sena , edina kutzora , judie jay , bori péterfy , enikő hodosi [ neo ] , and juci németh - ,  |||  whom  |||  we simply named underground divas .
b. zs . : we had had an instrumental version of it for quite some time . but then , when we were putting the cd together , we got the feeling that we  |||  needed  |||  to add something .
i remember being totally excited by it at the time , but the divas really were  |||  necessary  |||  to make it work .
hvg . hu : the girls  |||  appeared  |||  to be secondary , on both the disc and at the concert .
there is no solo ( excepting judy jay 's tiny one ) , they have no  |||  separate  |||  role , they sing completely in unison and they do n't outsing the music , so it 's not as though they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment .
on stage , they stood at the  |||  back  |||  .
b. zs . : the reason why they stood at the back of the stage was because of  |||  technical  |||  problems .
the whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time , not caring who came from where and where they are headed , and simply letting those wings , the wings of  |||  love  |||  , lift us up .
for instance dorian gray 's dilemma , where i play on a concert piano , or rock'n'roll goes to the girls , where the groove did n't want to work for the longest time - but  |||  everything  |||  eventually ended up fitting , kind of like a jigsaw puzzle .
at the moment it 's prophet is a fool ,  |||  escape  |||  from the earth , and never the same .
deceiving broker ventured  |||  billions  |||  due to inferiority complex
this is how the  |||  french  |||  banking giant société générale , the owner of the local komerční banka ( commerce bank ) , labels its ex - employee jerome kerviel .
on his  |||  account  |||  it has lost almost five billion euro .
more likely , it seems that kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to  |||  match  |||  his colleagues , and , moreover , definitely not an unqualified one .
unlike all the big banking houses , he recognized the crisis at the  |||  american  |||  mortgage market in time .
" he is psychologically  |||  weak  |||  , " were the words of his superiors , who directed the police to him .
but , as follows from kerviel 's testimony , which has been published by french  |||  media  |||  , e.g. the le monde journal , he was a man who gained 1.6 billion euro from his transactions by the end of last year .
" all i ever  |||  wanted  |||  was to gain some money for my bank , " he claims in his testimony .
in the summer he managed to gain a half billion euro from this  |||  american  |||  crisis .
he had found the  |||  opportunity  |||  at the beginning of the year .
the news appeared in february that the so - called sub -  |||  prime  |||  mortgage loans , provided to low - income clients or to those who had problems with paying them off in the past , are going to have problems .
nevertheless , the crisis should not have  |||  influenced  |||  the entire economy .
by the end of the year , his  |||  profit  |||  had climbed to 1.6 billion euro .
he  |||  managed  |||  to deceive his superiors , even though the eurex exchange became interested in his affairs .
|||  rather  |||  not .
" i  |||  thought  |||  that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them .
where did he get the will to  |||  risk  |||  that much ?
he entered société générale in the 2000 ,  |||  immediately  |||  after he had finished his university studies in lyon .
two years later , he was already an assistant to the broker , and in 2005 he became an  |||  independent  |||  broker with an annual income of $ 90,000 .
still he knew he would never earn as much as the  |||  others  |||  .
" as early as  |||  during  |||  my first interview in 2005 , i knew they despised me .
because of my education , and also for my professional and personal development , " kerviel  |||  described  |||  the situation to the investigators .
but soon after kerviel entered his career , the first big  |||  success  |||  followed .
thanks to the allianz shares he gained ; during the london bombings he bet a half billion euro that they would  |||  fall  |||  .
and that was the trigger mechanism - he  |||  wanted  |||  more .
but his superiors are said to have  |||  known  |||  , or rather suspected the whole thing .
but then , at the beginning of the year , a blow  |||  came  |||  .
in a  |||  single  |||  day , he lost 1 billion euro .
he  |||  wanted  |||  to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in the middle of january .
when he  |||  came  |||  to the office on monday , he was no longer employed by the bank .
and a few days later , the  |||  bank  |||  announced it had lost 5 billion euro because of him .
" i took only four days out of the  |||  last  |||  year .
czech republic has  |||  chance  |||  to get 365 billion .
the ministers of the czech government , together with the representatives of the european union ,  |||  signed  |||  nine operational programs yesterday , from which the czech republic can acquire 14 billion euro ( approximately 365 billion czech crowns ) in the following years .
this is roughly half the  |||  total  |||  sum the czech republic can acquire from brussels during the years 2007 to 2013 .
approximately 125 billion czech crowns will move from seven  |||  operational  |||  programs into the regions .
czech companies will be able to  |||  gain  |||  about 100 billion czech crowns from the enterprise and innovation program .
most of the money , up to 150 billion , will be directed into  |||  transportation  |||  .
the transportation program is the biggest  |||  operational  |||  program , it represents almost 22 percent of the resources which the czech republic can obtain from the funds .
this money will  |||  increase  |||  the budget of the state fund for transportation infrastructure , which will be managing a sum of 90.8 billion czech crowns next year .
the enterprise and innovation program ought to serve the entrepreneurs and companies to gain the resources for innovation  |||  business  |||  .
companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies , for the  |||  industrial  |||  research , but also for the introduction of more effective methods of organization .
as for the actual extraction of money from the eu funds , the czech republic is thus far among the least successful within the newly  |||  accepted  |||  countries .
a 20 - year sentence for the ex - president of nicaragua has been upheld by the  |||  court  |||  .
the nicaraguan court of  |||  appeal  |||  upheld the 20 - year sentence for the ex - president of the country , arnoldo alemán , in which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of up to $ 100 million ( almost 1.8 billion czech crowns ) on thursday .
however , he was later liberated and was under  |||  house  |||  arrest at his hacienda , not far from the nicaraguan metropolis .
according to the chairperson of the court of  |||  appeal  |||  , ileana péréz , it will now be dependent on the custodial officials , whether they will let aléman serve his sentence at home , or if he will go to prison .
the court  |||  proved  |||  four years ago that aléman had regularly shifted government money to the accounts of foreign companies in panama .
these  |||  companies  |||  were imaginary and the accounts were actually held by his relatives and closest adherents .
some of the money ended up in a fund which aléman  |||  established  |||  to finance his election campaigns in 2001 .
so they 've  |||  approved  |||  our budget
the state budget has been  |||  accepted  |||  .
the one for this year was  |||  passed  |||  last year still with the support of the czech social democratic party ( cssd ) , because it was prepared by minister sobotka and cssd could not afford for it to not be accepted .
in contrast to the animated  |||  debate  |||  before the vote of no - confidence in the government , nothing extreme has occurred this time .
it is a sort of  |||  paradox  |||  .
|||  each  |||  governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget , like it or not .
the budget is a  |||  substantial  |||  part of politics , but it is covered by the struggle for power between the government and the opposition .
it is more widely appreciated by the media , that is why the  |||  media  |||  pay much more attention to it .
the politicians ' quarrels are much more interesting for the  |||  public  |||  than straight numbers .
the  |||  state  |||  budgets of the past social democratic governments suffered from three maladies which 2008 's budget is not able to resolve all at once :
first , there is the high portion of the expenditures mandatory by law , the so - called mandatory expenditures , including not only pensions , but also social benefits  |||  passed  |||  last year before the elections by the silent " alliance " of cssd and the communist party of bohemia and moravia ( kscm ) .
|||  second  |||  , there is the deficit economy as a result of the first malady .
the third  |||  limit  |||  is the deficits in public financing , i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages .
however , the state budget deficit is not the biggest  |||  risk  |||  .
it is public and relatively under  |||  control  |||  .
the time  |||  bomb  |||  here is the deficit of the budgets of cities and villages .
in the past years , they  |||  managed  |||  to pay the debts off by the mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization .
they no longer have this  |||  resource  |||  .
if we stick just to the  |||  official  |||  and certifiable facts , we discover that :
our economy has already been passing through the phase of growth for a few years , as is the  |||  rest  |||  of the world , about which cssd keeps boasting .
this has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public financing in  |||  order  |||  .
other  |||  countries  |||  , with a few exceptions such as hungary , albania , pakistan or egypt , have managed the money much more reasonably than our republic .
it is a  |||  huge  |||  shame , which falls mainly upon the previous governments .
we are among the countries which are , measured  |||  globally  |||  , endangered by poverty to the least extent .
therefore there is no need for any  |||  massive  |||  social programs , which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in the past years .
with a bit of exaggeration , we can say that the governing politicians will  |||  become  |||  white - collar workers mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits .
the  |||  planned  |||  deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not lost as much as they could during the last ten years .
if we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white - collar workers , we have to be patient and allow the not very strong coalition government , which is  |||  aware  |||  of the fact that the state can give over only as much as it can obtain on taxes and charges , peace for the preparation of other reform laws .
only they will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced  |||  state  |||  budget .
banks want to  |||  solve  |||  crisis
the  |||  american  |||  federal reserve bank , the european central bank and the central banks of great britain , switzerland and canada have decided to fight against the crisis on financial markets together .
in public sales , banks bid on the interest rate for which they are willing to  |||  borrow  |||  money .
for example , the american fed will  |||  send  |||  $ 40 billion into public sale and make 24 more available to the european and swiss central banks .
it is the first time after the september 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states settled on such a coordinated procedure aimed at preventing or decreasing the  |||  effects  |||  of a financial crisis .
" this step should solve the biggest economic problems , i.e. the growing lack of  |||  free  |||  capital banks can lend , " wrote bernard baumohl from the counselling company economic outlook group in the report for his clients .
" the coordinated action of the central banks  |||  reduced  |||  the probability of the recession in the u.s. from 65 percent to about 50 percent , " added baumohl in the report .
banks have already  |||  lost  |||  $ 60 billion due to the non - repaid loans , especially in the u.s.
the analysts  |||  expect  |||  further billion - dollar losses .
" the central banks must be very afraid of what more can  |||  follow  |||  , if they decided in favour of such a procedure , " said the main economist of abn amro , kieran davies .
" it  |||  seems  |||  that the situation is really bad , " he added .
the central banks worry that if the banks themselves have a  |||  difficult  |||  access to loans , they will also lend to their customers for more .
that will lower the consumption and send the american economics into a recession , with possible impact on the  |||  economic  |||  growth of the whole world .
the central banks made this decision after the failure to lower the so - called libor  |||  rate  |||  , a london interbank rate , which is used for lending money on a wholesale market .
this meant that the banks still feared mutual money lending , even though the central banks of the u.s. , canada and great britain  |||  reduced  |||  their interest rates several times during the autumn .
" it will have the same  |||  effect  |||  as another decrease in the interest rates , " greg salvaggio from tempus consulting told reuters .
klaus : environmentalists '  |||  debates  |||  are unbelievable
global climate changes will mostly harm  |||  developing  |||  countries .
president václav klaus has again commented on the problem of  |||  global  |||  warming .
in vienna , where he presented his book " a blue , not a green planet " , he said that the environmentalists '  |||  debates  |||  were unbelievable .
according to mr. klaus , it is not only the structure of the conference , which consists of a strange mixture of government officials and nongovernmental organizations which cannot be accepted , but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the  |||  reality  |||  .
" the  |||  debate  |||  there is absolutely unstructured , it is just a burst of words which are a substitute for the resolution of current problems , " said mr. klaus .
the czech president emphasized during the presentation of his book that its topic is very  |||  important  |||  for him , which is why he is so engaged in it .
he also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book is also available in  |||  german  |||  translation , because , as he said , " i frequently encounter only caricatures of my opinions " .
so now everybody interested can  |||  read  |||  his undistorted attitudes .
mr. klaus  |||  mentioned  |||  that although he is no environmentalist , in his opinion he has enough qualifications to write such a book .
that is , he is an academic , able to observe and evaluate technical discourse , he is  |||  experienced  |||  in statistics and he is also an economist .
as the main conclusions of the book , he designated the theses that climates change constantly and their changes are thus normal , that there is no consistent opinion of all the researchers on global warming , that the effects of the  |||  current  |||  changes are not too great and relevant and so they do not represent any threat and that the efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are useless , inefficient and unacceptably costly .
moreover , as a man of experience with totalitarianism , he considers forcing unsubstantiated opinions on  |||  others  |||  , which he feels as a dangerous restraint of freedom , to be unacceptable .
mr. klaus had talked on the same subject two months ago at the hayek institute in  |||  vienna  |||  .
six hundred thousand drivers missed the  |||  deadline  |||  and did not manage to renew their old driver 's licenses , the validity of which will expire at the end of the year .
however , the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the  |||  road  |||  without a valid license after new year 's eve .
according to the authorities , it is mostly those who do not want to  |||  drive  |||  anymore who did not renew the license .
while villages report a  |||  sharp  |||  decline in interest in driver 's license renewal , the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week .
they spend about half an hour  |||  waiting  |||  in line .
the issue of a new license  |||  takes  |||  twenty days .
in that case , the  |||  driver  |||  pays five hundred crowns extra .
motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver 's license will be threatened with a  |||  fine  |||  .
a person who breaks the law will pay a  |||  maximum  |||  of two thousand crowns .
in case of an administrative offence , the  |||  fine  |||  will climb to 2,500 crowns .
according to earlier information the council could even  |||  fine  |||  someone who does not drive at all .
according to him , a driver 's license is a document which the people should be allowed to  |||  decide  |||  whether they want or not .
it is not an identity  |||  card  |||  which everybody must keep validated .
it is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or  |||  send  |||  it by registered post .
by the end of the year , the validity of the licenses  |||  issued  |||  during 1964-1993 will have expired .
people with driver 's licenses from 1994-2000 have  |||  three  |||  more years for the renewal .
the validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in  |||  december  |||  2013 .
according to hanzelka , this concerns roughly 2.6 million other  |||  documents  |||  .
|||  court  |||  reduces sentences for detectives affiliated with berdych
ex - police officers josef opava and petr koňařík , who are accused of  |||  criminal  |||  conspiracy with the david berdych gang , will go to prison for thirteen and ten years , respectively .
it was decided definitively by the high court in prague , which thus  |||  reduced  |||  their sentences by one and two years , respectively .
it is not possible to  |||  appeal  |||  today 's decision , only an appeal to the supreme court is possible .
|||  though  |||  berdych is charged in this case as well , he is still waiting for the verdict in the first instance .
nevertheless , he has already been given sentences in other  |||  trials  |||  totalling more than 16 years .
in january , the regional  |||  court  |||  found 19 people guilty , above all of the participation in felonies , the high court was dissolving the appeals of 16 of them today .
most of those charged refuted the indictment from the beginning of the investigation , claiming that it is a fabricated  |||  case  |||  .
in exchange , the  |||  gang  |||  surrendered 30 percent of the loot to opava and koňařík .
the indictment deals with the  |||  crimes  |||  of the gang from 1999-2001 .
namely , these were thefts whose victims often suffered  |||  serious  |||  physical injuries , but also the abuse of power and possession of illegal weapons .
according to the indictment , the gang made tens of  |||  millions  |||  of crowns in the thefts .
except for the nearly twenty men in this  |||  trial  |||  , the courts have lawfully convicted berdych and a number of other people of other thefts .
other men surrounding berdych are still testifying in front of the court in a  |||  different  |||  trial , but some of the cases have not come to the trial yet .
the trial has thus far avoided tomáš půta and maroš šulej , currently in an irish jail , where they await the decision  |||  regarding  |||  their version to the czech republic for prosecution .
an account of the baby switch : 12  |||  million  |||
the lawyer for the aggrieved families , igor veleba , is requesting 12 million czech crowns in  |||  compensation  |||  for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the třebíč hospital , plus legal expenses .
three million for each of the mothers , two for each father and a million for each  |||  child  |||  .
the hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for  |||  each  |||  of the parents .
the  |||  hospital  |||  's attorney , ondřej dostál , therefore radically disapproves of veleba 's proposition .
" we reject such a claim , it is too high , " dostál said after today 's  |||  meeting  |||  .
we will find out if it has any informative  |||  value  |||  at all .
still , we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all , " dostál  |||  stressed  |||  .
at the beginning of the case , the jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for  |||  each  |||  month they were not with their biological daughter .
according to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry , the parents of the children have suffered  |||  psychological  |||  injury and stress of various degrees and intensity .
the stressful situation was  |||  better  |||  endured by the men , though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies .
on the other hand , the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening  |||  right  |||  now , veleba summed up .
veronika and nikola were switched by the  |||  nurses  |||  in the třebíč maternity clinic on december 9 of the last year .
|||  last  |||  week , the children returned to their biological parents - nikola to the čermáks to přibyslavice and veronika to libor brož and jaroslava trojanová to jabloňov .
vysočina county supervisor miloš vystrčil gave 100,000 czk to  |||  each  |||  of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the třebíč hospital , run by the county .
all hospitals in the  |||  czech republic  |||  are insured for the liability for damages by law .
by now the courts have awarded relatively low  |||  compensation  |||  to people , with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers , exceptionally in seven digit numbers , in czech crowns .
" the quarrel consists in the fact that mr. harabiš and his team sponge off of bolek polívka 's popularity , " said polívka 's lawyer after the  |||  trial  |||  .
mr. harabiš is of the same  |||  opinion  |||  .
" after some years , they realized that the project was  |||  successful  |||  and that he could profit from it .
they want to sponge off of our  |||  labour  |||  , " he added .
a lucrative  |||  business  |||
in 1993 , he was crowned by the  |||  actor  |||  radoslav brzobohatý .
nevertheless , at the time it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious  |||  kingdom  |||  .
several years later , mr. harabiš came up with the  |||  idea  |||  of issuing wallachian passports .
from an originally prank act , a  |||  business  |||  and a lucrative enterprise have evolved , which harabiš then extended by establishing the company " wallachian kingdom " .
in 1997 , polívka  |||  agreed  |||  with the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts on visits to his farm and theatre performances to their holders .
who will ascend to the  |||  throne  |||  ?
the judge also  |||  mentioned  |||  today that harabiš only used the bare idea which polívka made public in the circus for his business plan .
" the popularity of boleslav polívka certainly  |||  helped  |||  the wallachian kingdom project , " said the judge .
but she added that the heart of the project was harabiš and his  |||  team  |||  , which has devoted itself to it so intensely .
the collaboration of currently quarrelling parties  |||  continued  |||  until the year 2000 , when harabiš organized an official coronation in vsetín for polívka .
from then on , quarrels begin to accumulate between polívka and harabiš , which culminated in the dethronement of " the king boleslav i  |||  elected  |||  forever and ever " .
on the instigation of harabiš , the  |||  leading  |||  role in the kingdom was then taken over by the singer jarmila šuláková as the queen mother .
in 2002 polívka brought a lawsuit against harabiš and his company , which the  |||  court  |||  overruled today .
he did not want to disclose any  |||  details  |||  or the schedule yet .
it should be  |||  something  |||  like the king 's ride in the slovácko region .
the king should be  |||  elected  |||  for a definite time span .
even mr. polívka can sign up , "  |||  added  |||  harabiš .
the test of peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti : melting  |||  prejudices  |||
to tell the truth , i have  |||  never  |||  rooted for peugeot 206 too much .
its handling characteristics have not been  |||  anything  |||  special , the quality of gear control , driving control and construction could occasionally have been labelled as mediocre .
but now there is its successor , the peugeot 207 on the market , and it is far  |||  better  |||  .
and the station wagon called sw  |||  goes  |||  even a step further and i cannot help but to give it another thought .
when i was testing the classical peugeot 207 hatchback , i complained for example about the headroom in the  |||  back  |||  seat .
i would  |||  appreciate  |||  some more designer inventiveness here , as the car itself looks so elegant .
the seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about  |||  short  |||  seats or seat backs are truly behind us .
also , the lateral seat support has improved markedly in comparison with the 206  |||  model  |||  .
considering the space , we can  |||  feel  |||  the build - up in the car body dimensions as well .
in the station , then , the already  |||  mentioned  |||  lack of headroom disappears .
i must evaluate it as very well  |||  accessible  |||  ( thanks also to the hinged quarter window ) and fairly spacious .
the blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics , which are an ideal  |||  compromise  |||  .
but not in comparison with the best selling car of this  |||  class  |||  in bohemia - the skoda fabia station wagon .
if we  |||  compare  |||  the 207 sw to the new generation of mladá boleslav products , we will see that the peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 litres behind .
for vacations in foreign countries or with a baby - carriage load , this number is almost  |||  critical  |||  .
120 horses in  |||  four  |||  rows
and to tell the truth , this is how a 1600 which powers a family hatchback should  |||  look  |||  .
it is  |||  quiet  |||  , it has low expenditure , and above all it really moves .
nevertheless , we shall bear in mind that we have tested a fairly  |||  equipped  |||  car with a spacious interior and a very good engine .
the basic  |||  price  |||  of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine of 329,900 czech crowns is not that bad .
but besides , we had the head airbags , the automatic air - condition , the automatic screen - wiper activation , the electric rear - window  |||  control  |||  ...
the car simply  |||  costs  |||  531,900 czech crowns all in all .
integration of slovak pupils in  |||  british  |||  schools not progressing
|||  british  |||  schools register even cases when quarrels between the immigrants and the children of the original population turn into violence .
the problem with the integration of children from eastern europe in  |||  british  |||  schools is exemplified well by the situation in northern kent , where quarrels between local residents and slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate .
arguments , bullying and fights between the  |||  pupils  |||  have extended to the relations between their parents .
the police also had to intervene following an attack by two teenage girls on a  |||  slovak  |||  immigrant .
the girls reportedly called the man racist  |||  comments  |||  and threw stones at him .
" when we were on our way  |||  home  |||  , a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit down onto us .
when i asked him to stop it , he pelted us with apples and pears and than he showed up his nude bottom , " a mother of slovak pupils  |||  described  |||  another unpleasant accident for the times .
the complaints come from both  |||  sides  |||  .
one of the local residents even classified the quarrels with eastern european immigrants as a  |||  fight  |||  for survival .
the above  |||  mentioned  |||  cases indicate that the mood between the locals and the immigrants at british schools is beginning to be strained .
there are 70 thousand slovaks  |||  registered  |||  in britain who moved there for work .
roughly 30 thousand slovak pupils , then , attend  |||  british  |||  schools .
|||  cuba  |||  the most beautiful island of the caribbean
for its  |||  visitors  |||  it is really an island of freedom .
golden and lily - white beaches ,  |||  high  |||  waves or a sea calm as a pond .
kite - surfing , golf and  |||  roulette  |||  .
you will find a  |||  full  |||  and even richer list of all this on the islands in the caribbean sea .
but there is just one  |||  island  |||  where you find much more , and that island is cuba , the biggest and most beautiful of the west indies .
under the reign of spaniards , cuba was the stronghold of their  |||  american  |||  conquest .
and then the american era  |||  came  |||  .
its building was initiated by one of the bosses of the american mafia , lucky luciano , because all that was illegal in the u.s. ( especially during the prohibition ) was welcome and  |||  supported  |||  in cuba , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
among his  |||  guests  |||  were , among others ,
winston churchill , ava gardner ,  |||  frank  |||  sinatra .
ernest hemingway bought a homestead in san  |||  francisco  |||  de paula , not far from havana , and he had a yacht in cojímar .
even you can  |||  leave  |||  your autograph on the walls in the havana bodeguita .
and the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around havana ever since , because the once  |||  imported  |||  zhiguli and fiat vehicles have decayed in the salty and damp weather .
though havana , particularly its oldest  |||  part  |||  , is significantly squalid , nowhere else in the surroundings is there such a great number of fabulous colonial sights .
other  |||  places  |||  have also been transformed into beauty , e.g. trinidad .
with respect to the fact that tourism brings in badly  |||  needed  |||  money , its development has the green light .
cuba offers one more rarity which is  |||  unique  |||  in the world , of special value to train lovers .
their wagon stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and so you can see functional trains there  |||  whose  |||  contemporaries elsewhere are now only in museums .
most visitors to  |||  cuba  |||  will not miss the best known spots .
and so there is no need to get into much detail about varadero or  |||  havana  |||  .
the viňales valley the viňales valley in the western part of the  |||  island  |||  is one of the most picturesque spots in cuba .
mogotes , limestone round - topped mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the  |||  bottom  |||  of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities , thanks to which even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth .
you can encounter its  |||  final  |||  shape if you visit one of the havana factories for cigar making .
an ancient city which was  |||  established  |||  shortly after the spaniards had colonized the island .
fame and fortune were  |||  brought  |||  there with the slave and sugar trades .
the colonial spanish architecture , deeply influenced by the later  |||  french  |||  colonists , has not changed much during four centuries .
trinidad , between the sea and the escambray mountain range , is a place so remote that even as late as in the 1950s there was still no  |||  road  |||  to connect the area to the rest of the country .
the isolation  |||  helped  |||  it remain apart from it .
if you have more time for trinidad than just one afternoon , other interesting places in the neighbourhood are  |||  worth  |||  seeing as well , like the playa ancón beach or the sugarmill valley .
in the evening , it is appropriate go to casa de la música , which becomes full of life at nightfall and the  |||  music  |||  abates there at dawn .
a tiny  |||  town  |||  easternmost end of cuba is described by some as the most beautiful one on the island .
this opinion is certainly influenced by the  |||  road  |||  leading there itself .
both roads  |||  leading  |||  there from guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity .
thanks to its inviolate nature , the eastern cape of  |||  cuba  |||  has been placed by unesco onto the world heritage list .
they make the best chocolate there , they have a columbus  |||  cross  |||  in a church ( which was actually created about one hundred years after columbus 's voyage ) and from the hill where the former castle and what today is the hotel el castillo stands , you can see several mesas , of which el yunque is the most famous .
you can fill many pages writing about it all : the coffee , rum , cigars , the sierra maestra mountain range , the bay of pigs and the isla de pinos , the tropicana cabaret , the shrine of the patron saint of cuba caridad del cobre , santería , and  |||  african  |||  religions , which are professed by the descendants of former slaves .
allies in afghanistan  |||  passive  |||  , americans say
according to the u.s. , the low number of soldiers and the lack of  |||  necessary  |||  equipment is influencing the course of the mission in afghanistan .
in addition to the  |||  growing  |||  reluctance of the taliban movement , eight participant states will also discuss other plans and the coordination of the allies today .
whereas the u.s. ordered the nato units through the secretary of defense robert gates to increase activity this week , great britain sees the priority in the reinforcement of the afghan government  |||  authority  |||  and the intensification of developmental aid .
" the  |||  development  |||  in afghanistan is tangible , but armed forces can only be part of the solution .
ninety  |||  percent  |||
according to data from the u.s. army , the activity of the afghan  |||  rebels  |||  is the greatest in the last five years .
the nato countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in afghanistan , about a  |||  quarter  |||  of whom are in the southern territory .
but according to the u.s. , the allies have reached the very  |||  limit  |||  in the organization and equipment of the units .
they are specifically asking for additional helicopters , soldiers and experts on afghan unit  |||  training  |||  .
the secretary  |||  general  |||  of nato jaap de hoop spoke today with a similar intent .
" i am not happy about what we have on the  |||  ground  |||  and in the air in afghanistan .
we have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need , and that is  |||  little  |||  , " de hoop told reuters at the end of three - day talks with the japanese government in tokyo .
who is  |||  passive  |||
there are some quarrels among the countries  |||  involved  |||  over whether all the allies are doing their best in afghanistan .
for example ,  |||  germany  |||  has been criticized for passivity .
" germans have rather a  |||  numerous  |||  representation in afghanistan .
yet they are stationed in areas of minimum violence and the  |||  combat  |||  requirements on them are not as high as those on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country , " said gates .
the british tabloid the sun labelled  |||  german  |||  soldiers as lazy this week .
" the afghan layabouts disclosed : germans play as our boys fight , " wrote the sun in material accompanied by photos of german soldiers playing  |||  table  |||  tennis .
|||  national  |||  debt to vault to a trillion in 2009
there is  |||  national  |||  debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each czech .
the total  |||  debt  |||  rose by the end of september to 842.7 billion crowns .
the government  |||  planned  |||  to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
but at the beginning of december the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved development of use of the  |||  state  |||  budget .
the czech republic 's  |||  national  |||  debt rose by the end of september to 842.7 billion crowns .
it has  |||  risen  |||  by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year .
|||  though  |||  it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns since june .
this is the way in which the ministry of finance confirmed its data on the  |||  national  |||  debt from the beginning of october today .
during all of  |||  last  |||  year , the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns .
" for now it appears that thanks to the lower deficit for the  |||  next  |||  year , we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009 .
next finance analyst vladimír pikora sees it in a  |||  similar  |||  way : " we can get over the trillion limit in the course of the year 2009 .
the exact date will depend on the  |||  next  |||  budget , which we do not know yet .
if the situation in the political arena were to  |||  change  |||  , the politicians would be willing to spare more , it could be postponed to 2010 .
but we do not predict such a  |||  change  |||  , " he said .
|||  debts  |||  are growing
the national debt consists of the debts of the central government and emerges above all due to the accumulation of  |||  state  |||  budget deficits .
the national debt is  |||  financed  |||  by treasury notes , government bonds , direct loans or for example by loans from the european investment bank .
the  |||  state  |||  's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year .
the foreign  |||  debt  |||  of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year .
the so - called marketable national debt  |||  reached  |||  803.3 billion crowns by the end of september and has fallen 13.7 billion crowns since june .
the average due date of the national debt  |||  rose  |||  to 6.5 years .
it is bad that the debt is  |||  growing  |||  , but on the other hand it shows that we will have something to trade when the pension reform comes , " pikora commented on the data .
better than  |||  expected  |||
it follows from the strategy of national debt financing and control for 2007 that the government  |||  planned  |||  to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
but at the beginning of december , the ministry decreased the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to  |||  improved  |||  development of the use of the state budget .
the sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit , which will probably  |||  reach  |||  76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year .
it also includes the  |||  planned  |||  maximal resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the czech consolidation agency , a ten billion reserve for pension pay - outs , financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the instalment payment of the loans from the european investment bank totalling 1.8 billion crowns .
she was liable to lashes  |||  punishment  |||  .
this 54 - year - old english teacher , who was working at the unity high school of khartoum in sudan , has been arrested last sunday at her  |||  home  |||  , with the accuse both of threatening islam and sedition , according to the article no. 125 of the sudanese criminal code , following many complaints of the children 's parents to the sudan 's ministry of education .
in fact , the case goes back to the month of september , when the school teacher asked her pupils , aged between 6 and 7 , to  |||  choose  |||  a name for the class teddy bear .
surely , muhammad is the name of the  |||  muslim  |||  prophet , but first of all it 's a very common name in sudan .
the bear  |||  itself  |||  did n't wear any label with that name , but the problem lies in the prophet 's representation , considered as an offence to islam .
a muslim colleague of gillian gibbons , who 's a teacher in the same  |||  school  |||  in sudan , has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith , " i 'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name " , according to him , it 's simply an " innocent mistake " .
it 's an opinion  |||  shared  |||  with many of the teacher 's pupils , who describe her as " very attentive towards her pupils " and " a person who never talks about religion within the class " .
moreover , it should be reminded that muhammad is the second most common name in great britain , which is written in english in 14  |||  different  |||  ways .
this name , which is often chosen by  |||  muslim  |||  families , is one way of honouring the prophet ( it is often given to the family 's firstborn ) .
for instance , is it  |||  possible  |||  to give it to a toy ?
|||  certainly  |||  , it 's a matter of interpretation .
they have n't reached any accord on the province 's  |||  future  |||  statute on wednesday , during the last negotiations ' session in vienna .
serbians and kosovo 's albanians completed on wednesday morning in baden , in austria , the sixth and  |||  last  |||  session of negotiations without managing in overcoming their differences on the future statute of the separatist province .
" it is regrettable that the parties have n't been able to reach an accord on the statute " ,  |||  declared  |||  the european mediator wolfgang ischinger , during a press conference in vienna .
emphasizing that the peace in the region was " at stake " , his american counterpart , frank wisner , urged belgrade and pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue  |||  beyond  |||  the end of the negotiations .
troika mediators , which gathers the  |||  european  |||  union , usa and russia , will go for the last time to serbia and kosovo on monday .
the future of the province populated 90 % by albanian -  |||  speaking  |||  people will probably be clearer when ischinger , wisner and the russian mediator alexander botsane - khartchenko will have submitted their report to the un security council , by the 10th december .
baden 's discussions , near vienna , were the sixth and last  |||  negotiating  |||  session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the united nations , last august .
americans and  |||  europeans  |||  consider that their mediation will end on the 10th december .
|||  unilateral  |||  declaration of independence ?
after eight years of united nations administration in kosovo , westerners believed that independence under supervision of the eu is the only  |||  viable  |||  solution .
pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the security council wo n't be in its  |||  favour  |||  .
|||  belgrade  |||  is insisting on an increased autonomy .
hashim thaci , the ex - commander of kosovo rebels and future prime minister of the province , expressed its  |||  regret  |||  .
but he added that the autonomy plan  |||  presented  |||  by belgrade " belonged to a past which led to murders and deportations " .
" domino  |||  effect  |||  "
the serbian president boris tadic suggested that a compromise was still possible , warning the kosovo  |||  albanian  |||  majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province .
belgrade fears a " domino  |||  effect  |||  " in a fragile region , weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s .
" for serbia , he said , this does not mean that a compromise is  |||  impossible  |||  . "
on tuesday , the serbian delegation insisted that  |||  every  |||  decision should be up to the security council , where its russian ally has a veto .
" kosovo 's parliament will have the last  |||  word  |||  "
" there 's just one acceptable solution for serbia within the security council " ,  |||  declared  |||  the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica .
" they should end as they began : within the  |||  security  |||  council . "
fatmir sedjiu answered the journalists that " kosovo 's parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that every unilateral declaration of independence coming from albanian -  |||  speaking  |||  people would be done by consulting the westerners .
bush snatches an  |||  agreement  |||  between israelis and palestinians
the president george bush  |||  announced  |||  , at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on tuesday in annapolis , in maryland , that israelis and palestinians had finally reached their accord on a common declaration .
he stated that the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the palestinian president mahmoud abbas  |||  agreed  |||  to begin immediate negotiations for finding a final settlement of the 60 - year - old contention between their two people .
in the presence of the two men , bush has promised to do everything to  |||  help  |||  them concluding a " peace treaty " before the end of 2008 .
in the meantime , palestinians have to demolish " terrorist infrastructures " and israel has to stop its settlement activities , declared bush , reminding both parties their obligations towards the peace " roadmap " they 've  |||  accepted  |||  in 2003 .
the head of the white house emphasized that the negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority chaired by abbas would aim at " the conclusion of a peace treaty solving every outstanding issue , without any exception , central issues  |||  included  |||  " .
at his  |||  turn  |||  to speak , olmert committed himself to future " direct and continuous " negotiations and to make an effort to end them in 2008 .
bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for  |||  implementing  |||  his " vision of two coexisting states " of israel and palestine .
charged by all arabic countries , arabia , whose participation in annapolis is a success for washington , is at the origin of a plan which proposes peace to israel in exchange for its own territories occupied during the 1967 's war , east - jerusalem  |||  included  |||  .
annapolis marks " a crossroad in the middle - east history , particularly because it faces the conflict 's roots and its  |||  central  |||  aspects " , prince saud says in his interview with an arabic newspaper .
according to the prosecutor , the police is not  |||  responsible  |||  .
what did  |||  precisely  |||  happen on sunday ?
as always  |||  happens  |||  in this kind of situations , official versions and rumours are the opposite .
what are the circumstances of the  |||  accident  |||  ?
according to the first elements of the inquiry run by the  |||  general  |||  ispection of the national police ( ignp ) , a police car was moving around on sunday , shortly after 5 pm , louise - michel street , in villiers - le - bel .
" there was no emergency , they were on patrol and the car was circulating at 40-50 km / h , without flashing lights " ,  |||  explained  |||  a policeman .
" it struck the  |||  police  |||  car on the left , failing to give way to its right " , stated a policeman .
the results of the alcohol test were  |||  negative  |||  on the motorbike occupants .
very quickly , yesterday morning , the pontoise republic prosecutor , marie - thérère de givry ,  |||  announced  |||  she had entrusted an investigation to the ignp for " manslaughter and non - assistance to people in danger " .
in the afternoon , on the occasion of a press conference , the prosecutor states that the inquiry of the igpn , at this  |||  stage  |||  , discarded the police 's responsibility .
according to the prosecutor , three witnesses of the accident , questioned on sunday evening , confirmed " the police 's version , that is the mini - motorbike arrived quite quickly on their  |||  left  |||  " .
yesterday , some kind of groove , maybe  |||  caused  |||  by the toeclip 's rubbing , showed that the two vehicles got stuck until the car braked .
an autopsy on the two victims'bodies was  |||  conducted  |||  yesterday .
what did  |||  happen  |||  immediately after ?
according to that  |||  point  |||  , the ignp , remaining cautious , would reject " any serious mistake " .
" it 's one of the most  |||  difficult  |||  aspects of the inquiry , which requires more investigations , towards which it 's necessary to be very cautious " , stated a policeman .
one of his  |||  window  |||  looked precisely onto the scene .
" we got off immediately , me and my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital ,  |||  trying  |||  to revive them , explicates the witness .
then , he saw " a policeman  |||  completely  |||  shocked , limping .
two other people tried to revive them , a fourth person was  |||  talking  |||  on the phone " .
always according to this witness , the emergency service arrived " about twenty minutes after the police  |||  departure  |||  " .
" i wo n't let anyone say that the  |||  police  |||  did n't help them .
|||  everything  |||  has been done trying to help them . " , emphasized in her turn the prosecutor .

nowadays , more than one pregnancy out of three ( 36 % ) is still unplanned , reveals a survey conducted by the  |||  national  |||  institute of demographic studies ( ined ) , forty years after the neuwirth law , which legalized the contraception in france , was voted .
|||  different  |||  contraceptives , such as the pill or the coil , have a failure rate which is still between 5 % and 6 % , estimated the ined .
in spite of that , the legalization of the contraception leaded to a better " fertility control " , explicates the institute according to which the  |||  rate  |||  of the pill 's use among women between 20 and 44 years old has nowadays risen to 60 % , against 5 % in 1970 .
finally , nowadays eight births out of ten would be well  |||  planned  |||  .

the astronaut scott parazynski and his crewmates of the interntional space station ( iss ) spent more than seven hours  |||  working  |||  in space , repairing a mangled solar array , indispensable to continue the scientific activities of the station .
but it is necessary to provide them with  |||  electricity  |||  .
in order to produce electricity , then , the second task of the crew was to  |||  move  |||  a 17,5 tons module for solar arrays , which was already in the iss .
after having moved the module , the crew  |||  started  |||  using its solar arrays , which have a wingspan of 76 meters .
in order to avoid  |||  further  |||  damages , the array was stopped from bending .
and scott parazynski was  |||  chosen  |||  for the stitching , on the end of the 58 - foot robot arm that was added up for the repair .
he is one of the  |||  best  |||  nasa spacewalker .

the  |||  status  |||  quo choice
there wo n't be any suspense at sunday exit poll : russians are opting overwhelmingly for the party of the president putin ,  |||  united  |||  russia .
yesterday , welcoming the foreign ambassadors , the president did not betray anything , bringing just a further charge against the west , accused of interference - his favourite  |||  subject  |||  during the campaign .
the communist  |||  leader  |||  guennadi ziouganov says that " there has never been so dirty elections , even in eltsin times " .
after the repression of the last week - end demonstrations , it 's still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop , garry kasparov , sentenced to five days ' imprisonment for  |||  illegal  |||  demonstration , said his lawyer .
" russians saved the homo sovieticus  |||  mentality  |||  . "
- who will be putin 's  |||  successor  |||  ?
the official journal  |||  published  |||  yesterday the date of the first round of the elections , on the 2nd march 2008 ; the candidates have time until the 23rd december to come forward .
|||  elected  |||  for the first time in 2000 and for a second time in 2004 , vladimir putin can not afford a third mandate .
- which role is putin  |||  going  |||  to play after march ?
|||  prime minister  |||  ?
whatever the case may be , at the legislative  |||  elections  |||  , as well as at the presidential ones , the outgoing party will triumph .
it is a  |||  tradition  |||  .
" russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality , they do not feel the owners of their destiny " , considers the sociologist lev goudkov , director of the levada  |||  independent  |||  centre .
nikolaï kopossov , a historian of the st. petersburg state  |||  university  |||  , goes farther : the civil society in this christianized country was five centuries late than in europe ; the well - known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism .
russians are " voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility " that they had briefly  |||  shown  |||  after the collapse of the urss .
the phenomenon affects every social class , business  |||  included  |||  .
and the administrative elite aims to  |||  keep  |||  the status quo : 65 governors ( out of 85 leaders of russian regions ) are heading the local lists of united russia .
the new freedoms imported from the  |||  west  |||  are often synonym of chaos , as it happened in the 1990s .
the public  |||  opinion  |||  prefers the stability .
it is the reason for which russians wo n't vote for  |||  extremists  |||  .
those who are in  |||  power  |||  are not so bad , why changing them ? "
the eleven states charged with their administration - among them germany , france , israel and the united states -  |||  agreed  |||  on may 2006 in making them available for research workers and historians .
completed the ratification process of the  |||  agreement  |||  , the archives are available since yesterday .
|||  sensitive  |||  information
up to now , many countries , among which germany , opposed the public availability of these private documents , because of the sensitive  |||  nature  |||  of certain information .
like the  |||  homosexuality  |||  or the mental handicap of some victims of the deportation .
nowadays , in bad arolsen , more than 300  |||  permanent  |||  employees still receive tens of thousands individual requests .
however , for some people of the scientific community , the access to bad arolsen has a  |||  limited  |||  interest .
" there is nothing new to learn from these documents " , declared in 2006 the pr wolfgang benz , director of the research centre on anti - semitism at the technische universität of  |||  berlin  |||  .

ump and nc  |||  refuse  |||  to examine ps 's proposals on the purchasing power
ump and nouveau centre groups refused on thursday to  |||  discuss  |||  some sections of the socialist bill on the purchasing power , that means they refused the text .

since ump and nc voted against those sections of the bill ( 180 against 115 votes ) , the meeting closed at the end of an often heated argument between majority and  |||  opposition  |||  , a few hours after the television speech of nicolas sarkozy on the purchasing power .

a new  |||  festival  |||  is coming
following many rumours on the creation of a new music festival in philadelphia by c 3 presents , this promoter / producer announces the vineland music festival in new jersey , in partnership with festival republic , organized by the  |||  british  |||  producer melvin benn .
" for our company , it 's an honour to collaborate with someone who has even inspired the  |||  current  |||  festival movement in america " , confessed charlie jones of c 3 to billboard.com .
vineland , in new jersey , is a summer  |||  destination  |||  for camping .
the festival is expected to be in a private  |||  farm  |||  of 500 acres about 40 minutes far from philadelphia and to last from the 8th to the 10th august .
formerly  |||  known  |||  as mean fiddler , the director of the festival republic , melvin benn , is one of the most respected festivals ' producer in the world .
in 1989 he organized the uk reading festival , which attracts  |||  every year  |||  about 80 000 people .
from 2002 , as a co - owner , melvin benn has been charged of the  |||  production  |||  , the licences concession and the organization 's tasks of the glastonbury festival , which nowadays can even host 177 500 people .
considering glastonbury " the most inspiring event " he has ever attended to , charlie jones of c 3 says that his company and melvin benn 's one are  |||  working  |||  side by side for giving the region a festival / event in european style .
" we chose philadelphia as our business and we 're hardly  |||  working  |||  with the fairmount parks commission for creating a festival in the centre of philadelphia " , states charlie jones .
" we were negotiating with the  |||  city  |||  and the commission was enthusiastic about our proposal .
unfortunately , we 've got bogged down in political issues because of the  |||  current  |||  administration , adds charlie jones .
" fortunately , we could  |||  talk  |||  to melvin benn and we 're going to create a wonderful festival in an extraordinary place which will be useful for philadelphia 's population . "
both festivals take place in an  |||  urban  |||  area .
" the european model of melvin benn is a country festival , while  |||  ours  |||  take place in open urban spaces " , says charlie jones .
vineland is more or less half way between philadelphia and atlantic  |||  city  |||  .
" vineland 's community , its mayor  |||  included  |||  , supports with enthusiasm this event " , says charlie jones .
he refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement , but he states " that they will allow to invest in such a great event and host a festival which , we  |||  hope  |||  , will last for a long time . "
he explains that , although the invitations have been extended to the groups , nothing could be  |||  confirmed  |||  yet .
his partners of c 3 , which  |||  received  |||  the top independent promoter prize at the last billboard touring awards , are charlie walker and charles attal .
montréal  |||  faces  |||  terminator
it is not  |||  easy  |||  for montréal to attract hollywood movies when the rejector is terminator ...
a politically difficult task because the governor of  |||  california  |||  , arnold schwarzenegger , denounces the " runaway productions " .
is it  |||  difficult  |||  to play the role of the " governor " ?
" you need to be  |||  careful  |||  , it 's the industry which decides where to go .
if it finds  |||  favourable  |||  conditions in montréal , it will go there .
our role , is to  |||  offer  |||  the best conditions " , he says .
the  |||  festivals  |||  race
currently , denis turcotte 's priority is to  |||  promote  |||  our cinema .
all festivals of the west coast , taking place in sundance , denver , seattle or san francisco , will have to  |||  present  |||  quebec films , give prominence to them and make sure to fix a meeting with all directors .
it will be introduced at the palm springs  |||  international  |||  festival in january .
quebec has also  |||  presented  |||  four feature films and four short films at the american film institute fest this month .
will there be a year - end rally in the stock market ? the experts are  |||  divided  |||  by the ' subprime ' crisis .
nevertheless , this year the  |||  experts  |||  do not clearly know if this will happen .
banif thinks that " from a statistical point of view , december usually has a positive effect on the  |||  stock market  |||  .
nevertheless , it 's not opportune to make forecasts  |||  based  |||  exclusively on statistics , even more so in the present context , where uncertainties are visible in the markets , at least in the short term " .
although they are n't in favour of a stock - market run in the last weeks of the year , the experts point to " the stock market , which is maintained by liquidity , arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees , especially the fixed rent , affected by the fled - effect towards quality shares as much in the long term as in the  |||  short  |||  one " .
for that , they think that stock - market will have a rather lateral behaviour , non -  |||  free  |||  of volatility " so we do n't know the impact of the fed 's probability reduction types , for the high level of crude oil and the stimulating danger of the inflationary tensions " .
javier barrio ,  |||  sales  |||  manager of bpi in spain , agrees that it is not a good time to take risks , thinking that there will be a rally .
" it is not a pleasing thing " , assures the  |||  expert  |||  .
ibex has lost nearly 4 % from the maximum reached on november 8th , when the index closed at 15945.7  |||  points  |||  .
even so , not all the  |||  experts  |||  share this negative viewpoint .
juan solana , intermoney analyst , believes that ibex 35 could  |||  close  |||  the year nearer to 16000 points thanks to portfolio reconstruction and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates .
on the other hand , federico olucha , inversis bank analyst , thinks that we are near to technical levels and " therefore , as far as the consequences of the crisis on the  |||  credit  |||  market , we could see a rebound in the index that could be impelled depending on the news arriving from the u.s.a. " .
the analyst trusts that this will be  |||  positive  |||  .
the analysts agree to  |||  choose  |||  the shares that will be the ones in charge for taking ithebex towards new maximum levels .
solana , of intermoney , affirms that " this year it 's the  |||  turn  |||  for the great stocks " .
the  |||  expert  |||  would include in the portfolio both : great banks and some constructors " because when the date arrives , the electrical sector will be very expensive " .
while , federico olucha , of inversis bank assures that the ascents will come from the banking and  |||  industrial  |||  sector .
" acs takes several months recuperating , and we hope that other construction companies like ferrovial and fcc go the same way " , explains the  |||  expert  |||  .
the consumer 's cycle will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the  |||  increase  |||  in the sales figures during the christmas sales season .
on the other hand , the  |||  expert  |||  thinks that the technological sales also will do very well although in this case there is not much presence in the spanish market .
five times in seven  |||  years  |||
in the  |||  last  |||  seven years , only on two occasions december has been a bearish month .
popular will  |||  open  |||  its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from monday to saturday
|||  popular  |||  has decided to renew a large part of their offices .
in total 200 ,  |||  located  |||  in the most commercial zones of spain .
these branches will operate under the mark  |||  popular  |||  max and represent a big change for the bank .
this is also true for the rest of the spanish banks , since this is the first group to decide to bet on an all - day aperture for their offices , until 20.30 in the evening , and  |||  open  |||  on saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours .
another group that has also reiterated in several occasions that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches , bbva , has not yet decided to make the  |||  move  |||  .
while , it 's near to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on the closure of 75 % of its offices on saturdays in  |||  exchange  |||  for opening late , although not to the public .
results from  |||  popular  |||  's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative , depending on commercial hours .
indeed this is the objective that  |||  popular  |||  is chasing with this project .
to catch the particular clients that circulate in these zones to make their purchases , to smes , the independent and commercial sales of the  |||  chosen  |||  streets to open .
the bank needs to have these 200 offices  |||  open  |||  in all spain within 18 months , since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing ones .
for that , the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial zones , adapting them to the clients profile of the  |||  different  |||  streets .
in this way , the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a  |||  different  |||  space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours .
the manager of the commercial bank angel creek assures that this reconstruction does not require a great  |||  investment  |||  , although an increase in personnel is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine .
the offices , that will even have meeting rooms for  |||  smes  |||  , will not sell financial products .
one positive  |||  experience  |||  for the group .
|||  popular  |||  has tested its initiative on three offices in madrid .
and it has been a positive  |||  experience  |||  , according to ángel rivero 's explanation .
branches of bravo murillo , o'donnell and gran via streets of madrid have been  |||  chosen  |||  , and it seems with success according to rivero .
and another 60 operate through the mundocredit trademark , specifically for immigrants , which have increased opening times , and even  |||  open  |||  on sundays and holidays .
in these popularmax  |||  offices  |||  they do n't replicate the bbva model , where several of their offices count on a great variety of non financial products for their commerce .
" we do n't want to  |||  compete  |||  with our clients " , says rivero .
at present , they have  |||  agreed  |||  with telefonica to sell cell phones , with personnel outside the bank .
for the first time telecinco doubles its  |||  stock market  |||  value when compared to its rival antenna 3
that  |||  gain  |||  puts the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66 % .
it 's rival , antenna 3 , that yielded 1.52 % and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5 % from january , is valued at  |||  half  |||  that , 2,193.46 million .
shares of other quoted communication  |||  companies  |||  rise ; to 3,571 million in the case of sogecable , 2518.53 million for prisa ( publisher of five days ) and 1.779 million for vocento .
according to vasile , " we are  |||  speaking  |||  of two similar companies " and hence the comparison with antenna 3 .
" the  |||  fact  |||  is how much are we able to operate within the same market , at what cost , and how we can profit in terms of customers " .
if the published data is true , the television network has registered this year an  |||  increase  |||  of 3,6 % in publicity revenue with respect to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise .
on the other hand , the net revenue of antenna 3  |||  increased  |||  by 1.6 % in the first nine months of the exercise ( reaching 734.4 million ) whereas the net income of the television grew by 0.7 % ( 630,4 million ) .
vasile assures that , although it is too soon to make a decision , this ratio may  |||  change  |||  after purchasing 33 % of endemol in partnership with its parent company mediaset .
" officially , we are  |||  committed  |||  to pay out a minimum 50 % , although we have always declared more .
this year , i hope that we are able to leave our shareholders , to  |||  whom  |||  we have already given good value with 33 % of endemol " , satisfied .
it happens , they explain , because of the cut in the anticipated growth of  |||  income  |||  from 10.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009 .
this same  |||  company  |||  has lowered the forecasted profit of antenna 3 to 4.5 % in 2008 and to 7.5 % in 2009 .
three  |||  views  |||
ibersecurities : recommends buying both shares  |||  based  |||  primarily on its high dividend yield and sustainable long - term potential .
caja madrid : viewed telecinco as better ( to accumulate ) than antenna 3 ( to  |||  keep  |||  ) for the ' multiples attractive ' and business increase .
jpmorgan : recommends to weigh carefully both cases for " similar threats " ( saturated market and worse  |||  economic  |||  climate ) .
alongside its parliamentary proceedings , that ended today with the partial voting of the congress on the amendments incorporated to the project in the senate , the government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will  |||  develop  |||  the new law , with the aim of coming in force before the year ends .
the representatives of different groups agreed in emphasizing the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and  |||  agree  |||  the best legislation for guaranteeing the protection of the investors and regulating in detail the organizations activity so that the markets work efficiently .
the mifid , which amends the securities market act , involves the modernization of financial markets , while it strengthens the investor protection , improving the supervisory powers of the comisión nacional del mercado de valores ( cnmv ) and encourages cooperation among the various  |||  supervisors  |||  of the european union .
in addition , it extends the number of systems available for the execution of financial operations , so included in the regulation are the secondary markets , the multilateral trading systems , and the internalization systems of orders , these will compete with the  |||  current  |||  stock market managers .
the law also requires investment services companies to disclose to the market the key details of their  |||  business  |||  profile , risk exposure and forms of risk management , and to keep a registry of all their operations to facilitate the supervision by the cnmv .
in their passage through the committee on economic affairs of the congress , several modifications were introduced , most notably securitised debts should be considered as a "  |||  complex  |||  " financial instrument due to its high risk for the investor , which has been demonstrated by what happened with the high risk american mortgages debts ( subprime ) .
in addition , the transposition took advantage of the directive to legally define the functions that can develop graduates in economics and finance in 30 years after the decree approbation in 1977 , that delimits the  |||  professional  |||  functions reserved to professional economists .
for its part , the senate promoted the creation of new roles in the financial sector , such as the financial advisor , who will work for hire or reward , not  |||  require  |||  sec approval and will be able to provide his services and marketing products brokerage to customers at various investment firms at the same time .
this indicator , that later serves eurostat to incorporate in the inflation rate calculation in the european union , provides a prediction of how  |||  spanish  |||  prices would evolve during november .
its publication corresponds with eurostat and the european central bank ( bce ) policy to offer high quality , timely data comparable with the ones produced in the  |||  united  |||  states .
this advanced indicator is calculated  |||  using  |||  the same procedure as that used by the consumer price index harmonized , but using different methods of statistical modelling to account for information which is n't available at the moment of its publication .
ine recalled that the information  |||  provided  |||  by the indicator is only an example , it need not necessarily coincide with the final data , which will be announced next december 14 .
" ipc will continue at relatively  |||  high  |||  levels " .
the second vice - president and economy minister , pedro solbes , has stated that the ipc  |||  increase  |||  to 4.1 % in november is a " temporary figure " , but at the same time expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at " relatively high " levels for the next months .
in any case solbes has emphasized in the congress corridors that " although the figure is not good " spanish inflation differential with respect to the monetary union continues to be " more or less " the same as in  |||  recent  |||  years .
also explained that november " has been less of a surprise " than in the previous month , when the government did not count on such a high  |||  increase  |||  .
" we  |||  expected  |||  a figure of around 4 % " , recognized the economy minister with respect to the advance data today .
virgin plans to make with  |||  northern  |||  rock 42,000 euros million in three years
at the time it needed deposits of over 25,000 million pounds , a figure that has been progressively falling in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the  |||  guarantee  |||  of the one hundred percent of that money offered by the government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis .
virgin , that would rename the organization to its financial trademark virgin money , needs to get around a quarter of revenues in  |||  british  |||  banks that are deposited in next the three years to obtain those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the objective of 30,000 million .
the group of the tycoon richard branson ,  |||  known  |||  for his showy advertising campaigns in the united kingdom , intends spending 50 million pounds ( about 70 million euros ) annually on publicity and marketing research to achieve his purposes .
detained the totana 's mayor for a presumed plot of city - planning  |||  corruption  |||
also  |||  arrested  |||  was a secretary of the consortium and the head of the municipal police .
agents continue registering the municipal dependants and the urban council and more arrests are not ruled out in the  |||  coming  |||  hours .
more , the object of the investigation , according to sources of the investigation , is the presumed fees charged by morales in exchange for facilitating the company / signature of a city - planning agreement with a galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of  |||  land  |||  .
at the moment , there are eight people  |||  detained  |||  .
bono accepts to head the candidacy of the psoe for toledo and to preside over the  |||  congress  |||  if won .
the ex - defence minister josé bono has accepted the offer of the government president and  |||  general  |||  secretary of the socialists , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , to head the list of the psoe by toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the congress in case the socialists gain the general elections .
in addition , it was also pointed out that " it seems " that the manchego group socialist candidate will preside the congress if the socialists win in the  |||  next  |||  elections .
bono would replace the congress president manuel marín , that on 15th november made public his decision of not standing for the next  |||  general  |||  elections and to abandon his career in politics to dedicate himself to fight against the climatic change in the university level .
the ex -  |||  minister  |||  has recognized that the government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago .
in addition , he has indicated that , like the citizens know who will be the  |||  economic  |||  vice - president if the psoe gains the elections , they have wanted to announce who will preside over the congress , in an " act of transparency " .
if he gains office , bono hopes to turn the house into " the house of  |||  respect  |||  and not insult or shout " . and make it " more and more visible to the citizens " .
" sometimes unfortunately it appears that the only place in madrid where it is not possible to be  |||  speak  |||  with confidence and calmness is the congress , the government president on one occasion was interrupted in the senate 26 times " .
also , he has praised the  |||  current  |||  president , manuel marín and " the good work he 's doing " and has not wanted to be viewed as already occupying his post , not to fall in what , his adversaries could view as " arrogance " .
climatic  |||  propaganda  |||
given that the movement against the climatic change , put under merciless persecution by the sceptics of its predictions like those that prioritize other political and social battles , is forced to  |||  show  |||  an iron determination .
and as leader of the movement and as the president of the government zapatero thinks that this fight is more important that the one on islamic terrorism and proposes to  |||  sign  |||  a " new contract with the planet " .
that approach forces him to explain why the  |||  action  |||  , or the inaction , of the government has contributed decisively to the spanish heading the ue breach of kyoto .
who are the people  |||  responsible  |||  for the breach , in which sectors have they taken place and why his government , the contract with the planet , has not avoided it .
that is , who will be sacrificed and who will pay to  |||  save  |||  the planet .
but there has neither been nor will be  |||  explanations  |||  .
|||  indeed  |||  because someone will have to sacrifice and pay .
measures against climatic change , the  |||  real  |||  measures , are unpopular .
such as the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the psoe , which close to the  |||  election  |||  may be dangerous to zapatero , who has hastened to deny it .
that is , which one is to  |||  save  |||  the planet without doing anything , with pure propaganda , with slogans devoid of all real consequence .
with impressive phrases , commissions , committees , protocols , new  |||  positions  |||  .
with contracts with the planet , this man , who neither speaks nor complains nor demands , but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness , is very useful for  |||  election  |||  campaigns .
always , if the contract part is  |||  limited  |||  to being only virtual , and we only pretend to move around by bicycle or to stay fresh with a fan .
detained the totana 's mayor and the  |||  head  |||  of the local police on a presumed plot of city - planning corruption
these three arrests are added to six made last monday in galicia , murcia and madrid , in an operation  |||  linked  |||  to the re - classification of more than 2 million hectares from rural land to building area , so that the galician company nuaria constructed 4,000 houses , after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature .
the six first arrests have gone before the  |||  court  |||  today .
according to  |||  information  |||  sources , the previous alderman of totana and actual autonomic parliamentary of the pp , juan morales , is being investigated .
in addition , the former wife , proprietor of a registered real estate agency in totana , has been arraigned , as is the  |||  current  |||  girlfriend of former alderman that resides in murcia capital .
the director and proprietor of the group nuaria , the lawyer and industrialist vigo manuel n.a. , was detained in nigrán ( pontevedra ) , as was pablo jose m.g. , ground director of inmonuar , an agency integrated with the  |||  mentioned  |||  group , and through which the bribes would have been made .
the investigation is the responsibility of the city - planning crimes group of operating central office ( uco ) of the civil guard , whose agents , in addition to the arrests , carried out eleven records , the majority to companies  |||  related  |||  to the detainees and located in madrid , vigo , murcia , pontevedra , madrid and totana .
one person was then arrested in totana , in particular , the owner of poultry product company well  |||  known  |||  in the region , that could have acted as an intermediary .
the company acquired in totana 2.2 million square meters of  |||  land  |||  that were re - classified and its project presupposed the duplication of the population of the municipality , that has 25,000 inhabitants .
if it seems to you , we are going to leave the book of the month , and see if in the meanwhile we have  |||  another  |||  awardology and other competitions .
life is  |||  change  |||  , people .
" the content of philosophy signature has come to the public attention as a result of the tragedy of the jokela 's  |||  school  |||  .
the education advisor and  |||  responsible  |||  for philosophy , pekka elo , demanded from the pages of the newspaper helsingin sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards plato and affirmed that to study nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of philosophy in the institutes " .
a  |||  colleague  |||  has passed information over the introduction in the penal code of the crimes over downloading from the internet :
a. the downloading of one song would be a criminal offence carrying a penalty of six months to a  |||  year  |||  .
however , if you steal from the music store for a value inferior to 400 euros , it is  |||  considered  |||  simply a misdemeanour ( article 623,1 ) .
b. if you steal from the store up to 1000 euros , the theft already is crime , but the penalty continues being inferior to the one imposed for downloading ( article 234 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) .
to participate in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year ( article 154 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) and the interchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
( article 270 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) .
e. sexual harassment at work is  |||  considered  |||  less serious than downloading a film on dvd , according to article 184,2 of the penal code .
f. the distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors ' authorization carries a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic  |||  material  |||  to minors ( article 186 ) .
well , if my colleague is  |||  right  |||  , somebody is stretching the law a bit too far .
my attending physician gave me an article on a rare investigation titled : " money produces brain activity , mainly if the others  |||  receive  |||  less ' .
that is , that the feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the  |||  workers  |||  depends on how much colleagues earn .
a study has been made  |||  using  |||  magnetic resonance at the university of bonn , and the results have been published in the last issue of science .
i do not know if this conclusion  |||  required  |||  as much science .
which  |||  insurance  |||  is good for me ?
because choosing the right car insurance is even more  |||  difficult  |||  than choosing the vehicle model .
first we must be  |||  clear  |||  what we are talking about .
the car  |||  insurance  |||  is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured .
the premium is the insurance price , which is  |||  established  |||  considering diverse factors , such as the age , sex , the length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
it is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums , since statistics  |||  show  |||  that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence .
the use of the  |||  vehicle  |||  will influence the frequency , and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap .
it is for this reason , that the driver has to study his situation to  |||  choose  |||  the insurance that better adjusts his profile .
presented here are the most significant variables in  |||  choosing  |||  one or another kind of insurance that , in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured , offers a reasonable price .
people younger than 25 years have  |||  diverse  |||  disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price , as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership .
|||  although  |||  , to be well insured , it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance , other economic options exist .
the most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any  |||  risk  |||  , so that they obtain the insurance coverage , but at a price more feasible .
this class of  |||  agreement  |||  would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps .
another option is an  |||  extended  |||  third party insurance , so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties , although not to those caused to his own car .
an  |||  advice  |||  .
if you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and  |||  avoid  |||  accidents as far as possible , since this will be an advantage , being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future .
if the company has had a good year it will be able to  |||  increase  |||  the advantages " , clarifies noguera .
once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance , since the accident index is  |||  reduced  |||  thanks to the accumulated experience .
" normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident , or even when driving " , assures the director in spain of the european company , to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving , once the "  |||  fear  |||  of the novice " passes .
nevertheless , if the client is married but still does n't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance , as long as his  |||  economic  |||  situation allows it , clearly .
in this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( this being of 300 euros ) , or , when it is had , a high benefit level , a third - party  |||  extended  |||  as the third life 's year of the vehicle .
it is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important , not only because it covers the driver over  |||  possible  |||  wrecks , but because it represents an important cost , reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation .
milan and celtic are playing on tuesday at san siro in search of the  |||  point  |||  they needed to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the " champions " league , as the italians are used to be first and the scots for his sentencing classification .
the italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in portugal , while celtic has nine points , but still needs another to make  |||  sure  |||  that the shakhtar , with six , and that benfica , which has four , do not overtake it .
these two matches of group d will be  |||  played  |||  in one week before the end of the sixth day , since milan has to play in the mundial de clubes in japan , where they make their debut on the 13 in the semi - finals in search of a place for the final on 16 .
so , this group will be closed before the rest and giuseppe meazza seems to expect a tie as the result , but the two teams will try to go for a win , and the italians will not want to speculate at  |||  home  |||  and celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals .
to the gordon strachan team could serve even a defeat for classified shakhtar if not wins , but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the ukranians pass , who  |||  lost  |||  last week in glasgow ( 2-1 ) , but won ( 2-0 ) in another duel live .
thus , milanists threaten to make it a bitter night for the scots , who rely on getting into the quarters for the second time in a row in the restructured champions league , after they were precisely defeated in this last round by a goal from kaka in the  |||  extended  |||  time ( 1-0 ) after 0-0 in the round .
waiting for the victory of the " rossoneri " will be the shakhtar to which only the win will do , in the event that celtic  |||  lost  |||  both get into quarters to continue in the uefa .
and as to benfica , despite being the last one and without any hope of staying in the top european competition , could  |||  reach  |||  third place with a victory , which play uefa .
20,000 people in vancouver attending the first concert of the spice  |||  girls  |||  ' tour .

" sporty spice " whose departure from the group in 1998 " for the differences between us " led the dissolution of the quintet two years later , also expressed nervousness during a meeting with the press , two hours before the  |||  start  |||  of the show .
" i was nervous to see that the world 's sense has  |||  changed  |||  , the feeling about the spice girls has changed .
and i thought why not , so i am happy for having taken the decision " said chisholm about the reunion of the group that she disbanded  |||  nine  |||  years ago .
the singer also  |||  noted  |||  that over time , " things have been settled and we still love each other a lot . "
but many things have  |||  changed  |||  since the spice girls acted together for the last time in 1998 .
to  |||  begin  |||  with , according to ctv television , the group arrived at vancouver in a special virgin airlines plane .
among the five joined seven  |||  children  |||  .

new  |||  russia  |||  - ukraine gas row fears
a fresh gas price dispute is brewing between ukraine and russia , raising the risk that russian exports of the fuel to western europe may be  |||  affected  |||  .
most of russia 's gas exports to the  |||  european  |||  union ( eu ) are piped through ukraine and any row between the two nations is keenly watched .
kiev has warned that if moscow raises the price it has to pay for the gas it will  |||  charge  |||  russia higher transit fees .
a previous dispute between the two last year  |||  reduced  |||  supplies to eu states .
the latest dispute between kiev and moscow comes as the ukrainian government and russia 's state - owned gas monopoly , gazprom , try to reach agreement on how much ukraine must pay for  |||  russian  |||  gas in 2008 .
gazprom says it will have to charge ukraine more as it has  |||  agreed  |||  to pay up to 50 % extra in 2008 for gas it sources from neighbouring turkmenistan .
analysts say this could  |||  mean  |||  ukraine having to pay 40 % more for its imports from gazprom .
" it is important for us to use our arguments as one of the top gas transit states during talks , " ukraine 's economy  |||  minister  |||  anatoly kinakh told the reuters news agency .
" the changes in gas prices should no doubt be linked to our arguments about the levels of  |||  transit  |||  fees [ to western europe ] via ukraine . "
the last  |||  major  |||  gas dispute between moscow and kiev saw gazprom cut supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
that lead to a knock - on fall in exports to  |||  western  |||  europe , which sharply pushed up prices .
|||  russian  |||  gas accounts for one - quarter of the european union 's supplies .
russia has the world 's largest  |||  stocks  |||  of gas , but much of it remains under - developed .
as a result , gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from turkmenistan and other central asian  |||  former  |||  soviet nations .
nhs ' must  |||  check  |||  foreign workers '
scottish nhs boards need to improve  |||  criminal  |||  records checks for employees outside europe , a watchdog has said .
mr black also raised concerns that nhs scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas  |||  staff  |||  it had .
the auditor general looked into  |||  staff  |||  recruited outside european economic area countries , in the wake of the glasgow airport attack .
bilal abdullah , 28 , an iraqi doctor at the royal alexandra hospital in paisley , was arrested at the airport after a jeep was driven into the doors of the main terminal  |||  building  |||  .
nhs boards are expected to carry out pre - employment checks on overseas  |||  staff  |||  to ensure they have the qualifications , experience and authorisation to work in the uk.
although scots health boards use disclosure scotland to carry out criminal records checks , the agency has no  |||  jurisdiction  |||  to obtain such information outside britain .
mr black said the scottish nhs had a high level of compliance with its own pre - employment screening policies , but added : " our report highlights areas where the system can be  |||  improved  |||  to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of overseas nhs staff . "
" the report suggests that current pre - employment checks are  |||  working  |||  well in nhs scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver , " he said .
scottish health authorities said they currently had 1,161 overseas  |||  staff  |||  , the vast majority of them doctors and nurses .
but the auditor general warned the numbers were likely to be higher , partly because boards had problems identifying which  |||  staff  |||  were on indefinite leave to remain .
the investigation also found that  |||  established  |||  check procedures at nhs authorities in ayrshire and arran , grampian , greater glasgow and clyde , lanarkshire , and lothian were largely being met .
these included  |||  passport  |||  , work permit and qualification checks .
the  |||  scottish  |||  government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre - employment checks for overseas staff in the nhs .
health  |||  secretary  |||  nicola sturgeon said : " i was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on glasgow airport .
she added the scottish government , in conjunction with health boards , would  |||  consider  |||  the recommendations of the report and would ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre - employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas - it planned to publish next month .
control , the biopic about late joy division singer ian curtis , has scooped five prizes at the  |||  british  |||  independent film awards , including best film .
trophies were also given to star sam riley , who  |||  worked  |||  in a warehouse until he was cast as curtis , director anton corbijn , and co - star toby kebbell .
dame judi dench was named  |||  best  |||  actress for thriller notes on a scandal .
rock music was the  |||  focus  |||  of another award - winner at the ceremony - as julien temple 's film about clash singer joe strummer took the best documentary prize .
the best actor gong went to viggo mortensen for his role as the driver to a  |||  russian  |||  mafia boss in david cronenberg 's london - based thriller easter promises .
ray winstone , who has a reputation for playing  |||  tough  |||  guys , picked up the richard harris award for outstanding contribution to british film .
winstone said he was  |||  proud  |||  to receive the award , named in honour of camelot and harry potter star harris , who died in 2002 .
" it was people like richard harris and albert finney that  |||  opened  |||  the doors for people like me , " he said .
he 's my type of guy , a great  |||  actor  |||  of the time , i 'm really honoured . "
the independent film awards ,  |||  known  |||  as the bifas , are selected by a panel which included filmmakers , actors and festival organisers .
bifa supporters and patrons  |||  include  |||  mike figgis , ken loach , ewan mcgregor , samantha morton , bill nighy , meera syal and michael winterbottom .
saudi arabia revealed yesterday that it had  |||  arrested  |||  208 militants for involvement in cells planning an imminent attack on an oil installation , as well as attacks on clerics and security forces .
|||  state  |||  television in the world 's biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles .
sympathisers of  |||  al-qaeda  |||  have mounted a campaign against the monarchy , an ally of the united states , since 2003 , following the invasion of iraq .
a cell of eight militants led by a foreign resident  |||  planned  |||  an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province , the tv report said .
it said the militants had  |||  planned  |||  to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom .
another 22 of those detained were reported to be plotting to assassinate clerics and  |||  security  |||  forces .
al-qaeda militants regard many clerics in saudi arabia as having been co - opted by the authorities into  |||  supporting  |||  the policies of the royal family , which dominates government .
" this was a very large effort by security forces over the past ... five months , " an interior ministry spokesman  |||  told  |||  state television .
those arrested also included 32 people accused of  |||  providing  |||  financial support to militants .
climate on venus may be glimpse of future for  |||  earth  |||
venus may  |||  once  |||  have been a pleasant place to live , scientists said yesterday .
data from an orbiting  |||  european  |||  spacecraft show the planet is even more like a wayward twin of earth than was previously realised .
the two worlds are about the same size and occupy similar orbits ,  |||  although  |||  venus is slightly closer to the sun.
billions of years ago , venus would have had conditions very  |||  similar  |||  to those on earth and may even have been habitable , scientists now believe .
but a runaway carbon dioxide greenhouse effect , atmospheric erosion by solar radiation , and a slower rotation rate  |||  sent  |||  venus down a very different development path .
today the planet is stripped of water , has a surface temperature hot enough to melt  |||  lead  |||  and is ravaged by hurricane - force winds and lightning storms .
the findings from the european space agency 's venus express probe , which has been studying the planet for a year , offer a sobering  |||  view  |||  of how earth might develop given catastrophic changes to its climate .
" our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which venus  |||  started  |||  out like the earth , possibly with a habitable environment , billions of years ago . "
' enriched uranium ' seized by  |||  police  |||
a kilo of radioactive material ,  |||  reported  |||  to be enriched uranium , was seized by slovak and hungarian police yesterday .
he would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been  |||  sold  |||  for $ 1 million ( gbp 480,000 ) .
nonetheless , the republican candidates for the presidency eventually  |||  agreed  |||  to face a youtube debate , in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates .
none of the questions aired on the evening of wednesday november 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked democrats about global warming in the other party 's youtube  |||  debate  |||  .
but the questions , and answers , this time  |||  reflected  |||  much about the state of the republican party heading into next year 's election .
but the first half - hour of the debate , the longest dedicated to any single issue ,  |||  focused  |||  on immigration .
the  |||  subject  |||  is one of the most potent topics for republicans .
he attacked mr romney , accusing the former massachusetts governor of hiring  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants to work on his house .
the two sparred particularly fiercely as questioners asked if any candidate would support an " amnesty " (  |||  giving  |||  illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship ) .
minor candidates like duncan hunter , a californian congressman , and tom tancredo , a congressman from colorado , managed to get digs in on the  |||  subject  |||  .
neither man has a prayer at the nomination , but both remain in the race perhaps because they  |||  started  |||  beating the immigration drum earlier and harder than others .
at least on immigration the candidates , broadly , share the same views : tougher borders , intolerance for  |||  illegal  |||  migrants .
this topic , along with fears of toxic toys from china or other worries about the outside  |||  world  |||  , helps republicans forget , or minimise , the divisions between libertarians and christian conservatives .
mr giuliani was asked why he had  |||  supported  |||  gun control in the past .
one questioner asked if the candidates believed  |||  every  |||  word of the bible .
this led mr giuliani to stumble towards the  |||  position  |||  that while the bible was his favourite book , he perhaps did not literally believe in the story of jonah and the whale .
another questioner asked whether jesus would  |||  support  |||  the death penalty .
mike huckabee - now , against all expectations , in first place in a recent poll from iowa thanks to his longstanding christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but  |||  necessary  |||  .
the race  |||  remains  |||  unusually wide open .
mr huckabee 's surge in iowa coincides with the libertarian ron paul 's recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at wednesday 's  |||  debate  |||  .
these two have surged from the bottom because the party 's two wings cannot yet  |||  agree  |||  on one of the better - known and more traditional candidates .
in 1980 and 2000 , a candidate united the party  |||  early  |||  and convincingly with a winning message about america 's greatness and winks to both of the party 's wings .
|||  labour  |||  pains
gordon brown has discovered yet another hole to  |||  fall  |||  into ; his way out of it remains the same
as  |||  british  |||  political scandals go , this one is not particularly juicy .
no honours seem to have been  |||  sold  |||  , no politician 's parisian hotel bills picked up , no extramarital toes sucked .
but the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to britain 's  |||  governing  |||  labour party of more than gbp 650,000 ( $ 1. 3m ) over four years under other people 's names , and that the party failed to report it , is one the embattled gordon brown could well have done without .
two months ago , when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election , stupidly insulting britons ' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision , the hope was that he would  |||  provide  |||  sturdy , efficient government .
the cack - handed rescue of northern rock , a troubled bank , showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under  |||  fire  |||  .
ill - thought - out proposals to change the tax code have drawn  |||  business  |||  groups together against the government .
the tax authority 's loss of 25m people 's personal  |||  details  |||  revealed unimaginable administrative bungling .
now there are the multifaceted donations from david abrahams ; peter watt , labour 's  |||  general  |||  secretary ( and its previous head of compliance ) , has already resigned .
none of this  |||  means  |||  that mr brown is headed irrevocably for the exit .
once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things , and may not even be around for long , that suspension is over : the civil service starts leaking ; cabinet ministers  |||  start  |||  briefing ; the press looks for bad - news stories ; and government becomes defensive and unfocused .
in one way , mr brown 's position is particularly  |||  difficult  |||  , because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom .
much though he would like to disown tony  |||  blair  |||  , he was his senior lieutenant .
the problems to do with northern rock and the tax - authority records , for instance , are  |||  linked  |||  to decisions mr brown made as chancellor of the exchequer .
and even when he was not directly  |||  involved  |||  in blairish mishaps - such as the long " cash for peerages " inquiry into political - party funding - voters may well assume he was .
yet mr  |||  brown  |||  's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks .
the new fuss about  |||  political  |||  donations is a good example .
that may be so , but the  |||  decision  |||  was not his to make .
the laws against anonymity for big political contributors are  |||  clear  |||  and they exist for a clear reason : the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land .
so far the  |||  prime minister  |||  has done half the job .
he was quick to condemn his party 's breach of the law , but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool , a committee of inquiry into the  |||  matter  |||  - led , for good measure , by a retired bishop and a judge .
in this case , the " lessons to be learned " are not  |||  complicated  |||  .
if the law has been broken , it is a  |||  matter  |||  for the police .
besides , there are other things that mr brown needs to do , such as finding a  |||  permanent  |||  chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life , which has been without one for six months , and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political - party funding .
but he should  |||  face  |||  some partisan facts .
the conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls ; he has two years to win  |||  back  |||  voters ; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence .
|||  card  |||  sharks
is the subprime  |||  mortgage  |||  crisis infecting america 's credit - card market ?
when there is blood in the water , it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl  |||  around  |||  excitedly .
now that america 's housing market is ailing , predators have their sights on the country 's credit -  |||  card  |||  market .
analysts at goldman sachs reckon that credit - card losses could reach $ 99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other forms of consumer  |||  credit  |||  .
signs of  |||  strain  |||  are clearly visible .
there are rises in both the charge - off and delinquency rates , which measure the share of balances that are uncollectible or more than 30 days  |||  late  |||  respectively .
hsbc announced  |||  last  |||  month that it had taken a $ 1.4 billion charge in its american consumer - finance business , partly because of weakness among card borrowers .
it is too  |||  early  |||  to panic , though .
according to moody 's , a rating agency , the third - quarter delinquency rate of 3.89 % was almost a full percentage  |||  point  |||  below the historical average .
the deterioration in  |||  rates  |||  can be partly explained by technical factors .
a change in america 's personal - bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt  |||  fall  |||  in bankruptcy filings , which in turn account for a big chunk of credit - card losses ; the number of filings ( and thus charge - off rates ) would be rising again , whether or not overall conditions for borrowers were getting worse .
the industry also reports solid payment rates , which  |||  show  |||  how much of their debt consumers pay off each month .
and confidence in credit - card asset - backed securities is pretty  |||  firm  |||  despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance .
dennis moroney of towergroup , a research  |||  firm  |||  , predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25 % higher than last year .
but card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values , so falling  |||  house  |||  prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers ' creditworthiness .
they may even work to issuers '  |||  advantage  |||  .
the incentives for consumers to keep  |||  paying  |||  the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan ; card debt rises higher up the list of repayment priorities as a result .
card issuers are also able to respond much more swiftly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders are , by  |||  changing  |||  interest rates or altering credit limits .
that should in theory  |||  reduce  |||  the risk of a rapid repricing of assets .
" we are not going to wake up one day and totally revalue the loans , " says gary perlin ,  |||  capital  |||  one 's chief financial officer .
if a sudden subprime - style meltdown in the credit - card market is improbable , the risks of a sustained downturn are much more  |||  real  |||  .
if lower house prices and a contraction in credit push america into recession , the industry will undoubtedly  |||  face  |||  a grimmer future .
|||  british  |||  bankers plead guilty in enron case
three british bankers who were set to go to trial for their roles in a fraudulent scheme with former enron chief financial officer andrew fastow  |||  changed  |||  their pleas to guilty wednesday .
david bermingham , giles darby and gary mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent to seven counts of wire  |||  fraud  |||  for allegedly colluding with fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at their employers ' expense .
they were set to go on  |||  trial  |||  in january .
but during a court hearing before u.s. district judge ewing werlein jr. ,  |||  each  |||  pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud .
the three former executives at greenwich natwest , a unit of royal bank of scotland group plc , became a cause celebre in britain  |||  throughout  |||  extradition proceedings that lasted two years .
in the united states , their  |||  case  |||  is a loose end of an investigation launched after enron 's 2001 collapse .
charges initially filed against them in 2002 alerted fastow that he was a target of the  |||  government  |||  's investigation into enron 's downfall .
the indictment against the bankers -- dubbed the " natwest three " -- alleges they  |||  came  |||  to houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with fastow and his former top aide , michael kopper .
greenwich natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an enron partnership  |||  controlled  |||  by fastow , who was the architect of a myriad of fraudulent enron schemes that helped fuel its spiral into bankruptcy proceedings .
in early 2002 , the bank had valued its interest in the subsidiary at zero , but the three british men knew it actually had  |||  significant  |||  value .
the bankers  |||  paid  |||  kopper $ 250,000 for an interest in this company .
according to the indictment , fastow falsely represented to enron that the  |||  energy  |||  company would pay $ 20 million to greenwich natwest for its shares of the subsidiary .
but the $ 20 million actually went to the british bankers , fastow and  |||  others  |||  .
the bankers got $ 7.3 million while fastow , kopper and  |||  others  |||  skimmed about $ 12.3 million , according to the indictment .
in january 2004 , fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in enron 's  |||  collapse  |||  .
the british trio was  |||  arrested  |||  three months later .
fastow is serving a six - year sentence in a  |||  federal  |||  prison in louisiana .
kopper is serving a three - year , one - month  |||  sentence  |||  at a facility in texarkana .
each of the three british men have been  |||  free  |||  on $ 1 million bonds that required them to live in the united states pending trial .
enron , once the nation 's seventh - largest company , crumbled into bankruptcy in december 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or make failing ventures  |||  appear  |||  profitable .
the collapse wiped out thousands of  |||  jobs  |||  , more than $ 60 billion in market value and more than $ 2 billion in pension plans .
enron founder kenneth lay and former chief executive jeffrey skilling were convicted  |||  last  |||  year for their roles in the company 's collapse .
lay 's convictions for conspiracy , fraud and other charges were wiped out after he died of  |||  heart  |||  disease last year .
but that is small change to some of the  |||  russian  |||  rich .
" it seats up to 18 passengers , " said dan firer , a gulfstream  |||  representative  |||  .
mr. firer was manning the gulfstream booth  |||  last  |||  friday at the millionaire fair , a four - day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital .
" that 's a  |||  nice  |||  car , but it is nickels and dimes compared to us , " he said .
" after the  |||  united  |||  states , russia is the second - biggest market for private aircraft . "
fueled by an oil boom , the  |||  russian  |||  capital seems as awash in cash as dallas was in its heyday .
" we went through the same thing in the 1890s when some americans came into giant wealth and flocked to europe , where they were viewed as materialistic , " said marshall goldman , a senior scholar at the davis centre for  |||  russian  |||  and eurasian studies at harvard university .
the most exclusive luxury brands are  |||  seeking  |||  their share of the klondike .
( the conference is organized by the international herald tribune , which is owned by the new york times  |||  company  |||  . )
russia has 53 billionaires worth a  |||  total  |||  of $ 282 billion , according to the forbes list of the richest people .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the second - tier rich include 103,000 russian millionaires who are collectively worth $ 670 billion , according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former soviet union written by economists at the centre for economic and financial research , a think tank here .
( the world  |||  bank  |||  says that in 2005 , 15.8 percent of russians lived below subsistence level . )
" there are hundreds of millionaires in moscow - that is why we are all here , " said nicole marais , a sales and marketing  |||  representative  |||  for david morris , the london jeweller .
she was attending the  |||  fair  |||  for the first time in conjunction with the brand 's russian distributor , the soho jewelry group .
" the  |||  women  |||  are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune . "
wandering the halls sunday night , dressed in evening attire , two real estate agents , evgenia yumatova , 21 , and svetlana turovtsova , 26 , described both  |||  themselves  |||  and their clients as millionaires .
" i was looking at the cars and i 'm trying to  |||  decide  |||  between the infiniti , the mercedes and the porsche , " said ms. yumatova , who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with joan rivers .
the fair seemed primarily  |||  aimed  |||  at the nouveaux riches , the type of brand - driven russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed cadillac escalades , platinum penknives , mövenpick ice cream , custom pool tables , apartments in dubai and gund teddy bears .
|||  members  |||  of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( $ 44.57 ) .
" russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best , " said mr. gijrath , who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the  |||  dutch  |||  porcelain manufacturer royal delft , in front of a wall - size re - creation of a rembrandt painting made of hand - painted blue tile .
" of course ,  |||  russians  |||  are more interested in bling - bling . "
on the first night of the show last thursday , roman ershov , the  |||  general  |||  manager of king koil beds here , said he had sold two $ 70,000 mattress sets made of silk , cashmere and cotton , interwoven with gold threads .
also on the first night , mikhail lyubiumov , the sales manager for a 1 moto , a company that outfits high - end cars with high - end alarm systems , said that his company had  |||  sold  |||  the bright orange porsche , for $ 170,000 , to a russian millionaire .
by sunday afternoon , andrei karapetian , the president of l.a. connection , a company that customizes luxury cars , said he had  |||  sold  |||  three car grilles , resembling interlinked chain bracelets , for rolls - royce phantoms , at $ 55,000 each .
he showed a reporter a car wheel ,  |||  designed  |||  for a russian casino owner , with spokes that he had encrusted with coloured swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
the cost : $ 22,000 for a set of  |||  four  |||  .
even if many of his russian clients are rich , mr. karapetian said the phrase " russian millionaire " did not convey much exclusivity at the  |||  moment  |||  , given the surge in real estate prices here .
" if you bought an apartment in moscow three or four years ago , you are probably already a millionaire , at least on  |||  paper  |||  if not in cash , " he said .
those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the  |||  stand  |||  run by alliance continental , a russian asset management firm .
the company had erected four red  |||  british  |||  - style telephone booths , stuffed with piles of counterfeit million - dollar greenbacks .
passers - by stopped to toss piles of money  |||  around  |||  , ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth , or just to pocket a couple of million .
" you see , in moscow , everyone can  |||  feel  |||  himself a millionaire , " mr. karryev said .
botched surgery suspected in a  |||  death  |||  in new jersey
|||  soon  |||  , there was a police patrol car .
and then there was  |||  another  |||  .
" that 's when i knew  |||  somebody  |||  was gone . "
now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon , whom the police did not identify ,  |||  working  |||  in the house at 212 west scott avenue .
the authorities have not yet determined what  |||  caused  |||  ms. arroyo 's death , and are hopeful that toxicology tests , the results of which might not be available for weeks , will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of the newark police .
ms. arroyo had been an assistant to the police director , garry f. mccarthy , since september 2006 , and her voice was  |||  familiar  |||  to many in the department .
" she was loyal ,  |||  hard  |||  - working and tenacious , " mr. mccarthy said of ms. arroyo in a telephone interview on wednesday .
she would  |||  protect  |||  me . "
mr. mccarthy said that ms. arroyo was the wife of jimmy arroyo , a  |||  former  |||  newark police officer who works for the alcoholic beverage control commission , and that she leaves two sons , 14 and 11 , and a stepdaughter .
eileen walsh , a spokeswoman for the union county prosecutor , theodore j. romankow , said that detectives were trying to determine whether ms. arroyo  |||  died  |||  as the result of an unlicensed surgical procedure .
" that 's one of the  |||  possibilities  |||  , " ms. walsh said .
the authorities said they arrived at the  |||  house  |||  about 3 p.m. on nov.
more than a week has gone by , and the authorities have said  |||  little  |||  about their investigation or about the owner of the house , who is listed as flor margarita castro .
ms. walsh would not say whether ms. castro had been interviewed by the  |||  authorities  |||  .
investigators are trying to  |||  determine  |||  whether part of the house was used as a medical office .
on  |||  wednesday  |||  , no one answered the door at ms. castro 's home , where a withered rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian barked in the back .
a  |||  blue  |||  drum labelled " ethyl vanillin " - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in a carport , next to a door that led to the basement .
two  |||  mountain  |||  bikes hung from hooks off to one side .
mr. mccarthy said that when he first arrived in newark after spending 25 years with the new york police department , ms. arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city 's insular and rough - hewn  |||  political  |||  culture .
hopes that fed will cut rates  |||  lead  |||  to world stock market surge
stock markets surged in london , new york and across europe after donald kohn , no 2 to ben bernanke , the fed 's chairman , said that policymakers must be " flexible and pragmatic " in responding to  |||  continued  |||  stress in financial markets .
in a clear effort to reassure fretful markets amid signs of resurgent  |||  credit  |||  strains , mr kohn said that recent turbulence had " partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of september and in october " .
should the elevated turbulence persist , it would  |||  increase  |||  the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses , he said .
the comments were taken by investors as a signal that the fed stands ready to step in with fresh injections of capital into us markets , and possible further interest rate cuts , to stabilise  |||  credit  |||  conditions .
the remarks also helped to calm wall street amid more bad news on the us economy , as  |||  sales  |||  of us homes hit a record low in october .
the fallout from financial turmoil was emphasised by an announcement from bear stearns , the investment bank , that it will cut 650 jobs , or 4 per cent of its global workforce , in a round of cost - cutting to offset heavy losses from its losing bets on the us sub - prime  |||  home  |||  loans sector .
only 20 of those  |||  posts  |||  are expected to go in london , where the bank employs 1,500 people .
in new york , the dow jones industrial average jumped by 331 points , or 2.55 per cent , to  |||  close  |||  at 13,289.40 , while the broader - based s&p 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent .
germany 's dax index  |||  rose  |||  2.6 per cent , and france 's cac 40 was up 2.3 per cent .
earlier , the re - emergence of  |||  credit  |||  stress in the markets was high - lighted after strong demand in an auction of three - month funds by the european central bank saw those loaned to europe 's commercial banks at a hefty 4.7 per cent , the highest rate since april 2001 .
pressure on the bank of england to  |||  follow  |||  the fed and ecb and inject extra funds into money markets in london mounted as credit strains saw three - month " libor " rates for lending between uk banks pushed to their highest since late september , at 6.59 per cent , after a steady climb since november 12 .
here are two dilemmas , each almost as  |||  difficult  |||  as the other .
who should bat at no 6 for  |||  england  |||  in kandy this weekend , owais shah or ravi bopara ?
and , no less  |||  relevant  |||  in a wider context than the first test against sri lanka , who should make the decision ?
the second question is  |||  relevant  |||  because david graveney , the chairman of selectors who is on borrowed time under that particular title at least , is here to help peter moores , the head coach , and michael vaughan , the captain , to decide and because the desk of hugh morris , the england managing director , is starting to fill up with applications to become national selector , if not a part - time one .
it is not only in cricket that selection is  |||  difficult  |||  , requiring judgment that always has to be subjective in the end .
who is to say what the  |||  right  |||  level is for a cricketer , unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one ?
|||  figures  |||  , naturally , have a large bearing on decisions , but so do opportunities .
within a team , a cricketer has to catch the captain 's eye at the  |||  right  |||  time if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one - day cricketer .
there were many who did better last season , for example , than james anderson , who looks  |||  certain  |||  to play in the first test even if stephen harmison declares himself fit and bowls like the wind in the nets .
anderson took 32 first - class wickets at 33 runs  |||  each  |||  to earn a place on this tour .
chris tremlett  |||  took  |||  only 29 at the same modest average , but both have had their moments at the highest level and hope for more of them .
whether shah or bopara plays at the asgiriya stadium can be only a  |||  matter  |||  of opinion .
four years ago in sri lanka , gareth batty played in every test and did well in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , but it was paul collingwood , struggling to establish himself at the same time , who came through to become a substantial test cricketer and , despite scoring a  |||  double  |||  hundred against australia in australia , may still be underestimated .
the probability is that graveney , vaughan and moores , after one more discussion in the wake of today 's net session at the asgiriya stadium , will  |||  follow  |||  their conservative instincts and plump for shah 's greater experience over bopara 's youthful exuberance .
there are  |||  arguments  |||  for both .
but shah made only ten runs in his two innings in may against west indies in the test at lord 's , his  |||  home  |||  venue as a middlesex player , and that , plus the immediate rejection by the selectors when vaughan was fit to reclaim his place for the next match , seems to have taken from his batting some of the élan that was evident in bombay .
bopara is much the better fielder , he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some  |||  effect  |||  here on pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill .
choosing the right man is one thing , choosing the right  |||  moment  |||  another .
perhaps that is the  |||  real  |||  art of selection .
my inclination would be to give bopara his chance now , which is not to say that shah might not excel if , as the ceylon tea leaves  |||  suggest  |||  , it is he who plays here this weekend .
the first bus loads of iraqi refugees from syria  |||  started  |||  arriving in baghdad yesterday , spewing out exiles who had run out of cash or visa extensions and others who hoped that the city was returning to normality .
some had even come back to fight the militants who drove them from their  |||  homes  |||  .
at the mansour bus station , even before the arrival from damascus of 800 people in an official government convoy of a dozen buses , the terminal was busy with refugees from syria and jordan who had  |||  returned  |||  in private transport .
" i decided to go to syria after they  |||  killed  |||  many doctors in baghdad , " sabah al-qubaisi , a sunni doctor , said .
" i  |||  returned  |||  today because of what i saw on tv and what i keep reading in the newspapers , about what happened to baghdad and how it was safe now .
they say the mahdi army  |||  stopped  |||  killing people , " he said , referring to the shia militia of militant cleric moqtada al-sadr , who has ordered his forces to stand down for the moment .
qassim al atwani , a 38 - year - old shia teacher from the predominantly sunni area of amariyah , returned with his two children because he was  |||  unable  |||  to renew his syrian visa and because the regime prevented iraqis from working .
his shia neighbours in amariyah telephoned to tell him that a local us - backed militia force had helped to drive al-qaeda out from their bastion in the west of the capital , and urged him to  |||  return  |||  .
one of the new arrivals from jordan was the head of a sunni and shia tribe who had been driven from his  |||  home  |||  in sleikh in northern baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up to fight al-qaeda .
he had come back to  |||  fight  |||  .
many spoke of being lured by the  |||  increased  |||  calm in the capital since the us troop surge and growth of local " concerned citizens groups " , armed and working with the us military to defend their neighbourhoods .
salaam al-samarrai , a 51 - year - old father of three , gave voice to common suspicion among the exiles that nouri al-maliki , the shia prime minister , had asked the syrian government to impose visa restriction on the refugees to force people to  |||  return  |||  .
more than two and  |||  half  |||  million people are believed to have fled the country 's sectarian death squads .
" we were ok until al-maliki visited syria and pushed the government to stop  |||  giving  |||  the iraqis visas , to force them to go back to iraq , " the sunni pensioner said .
" i ca n't trust a government that supports the criminals who burnt down my house after i  |||  left  |||  . "
there are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions again and lead to  |||  fighting  |||  .
in one field of  |||  education  |||  , however , saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country .
at the same time , france and luxemburg play major roles in saarland 's educational system , which , according to a so - called education monitor of the german business institute ( iw ) , cologne , ranks  |||  fifth  |||  .
saarbrücken 's university was founded by the  |||  french  |||  in 1948 .
even now ,  |||  students  |||  there have the opportunity to obtain bi - national or even tri - national degrees .
as a consequence , the share of foreign students is  |||  large  |||  , making up 15.6 percent .
" in saarland , many people make use of the vocational education system , "  |||  says  |||  axel plünnecke , education expert at the iw .
more than  |||  every  |||  fifth adolescent acquires their higher - education entrance qualification at a vocational school , which places saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points .
opportunities to  |||  combine  |||  vocational and academic education are developed comparatively strongly .
relative to  |||  population  |||  , the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in germany .
despite a practice - oriented education and  |||  increasing  |||  demand , the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years .
consequently , saarland 's department of education is committing university - level institutions to a marketing campaign for  |||  engineering  |||  sciences .
" after the first pisa survey , we initiated a number of reforms at  |||  general  |||  - education schools , " a spokeswoman for the department of education says .
for instance , the  |||  government  |||  introduced statewide comparative tests .
whether the students ' performance has  |||  improved  |||  substantially , future comparative surveys will show .
the 2003 pisa survey showed the share of at - risk  |||  students  |||  shrinking from 29 to 20 percent .
|||  overall  |||  , saarland did not improve as much as other german federal states , however .
bavarins are  |||  better  |||  at mathematics .
and , much to the chagrin of saarlanders , pisa does not evaluate foreign  |||  language  |||  skills -- an area in which they might score .
after all , studying the neighbours ' language is mandatory at college - preparatory high schools - even  |||  though  |||  saarlanders are not frenchmen .
in venezuela ,  |||  times  |||  are about to change .
president hugo chávez has decreed that time - pieces in the south american country be turned  |||  back  |||  by half an hour on december 9 .
in spain , meanwhile , chávez is  |||  becoming  |||  a figure of ridicule .
according to the  |||  official  |||  gazette of venezuela , a new law decrees that clocks be set to gmt minus four and a half hours .
thereby , the south american state creates its own time  |||  zone  |||  that does not apply to any other country in the world .
chávez , whose disposition towards the us has been hostile , cited a number of reasons for his decision . notably , he alleged that the world 's division into time  |||  zones  |||  according to full clock hours was an imposition by the united states .
on wednesday ( local time ) , chávez also announced a severance of diplomatic  |||  ties  |||  with neighbouring country colombia due to a hostage crisis .
as long as conservative alvaro uribe remained president of colombia , the left - wing  |||  nationalist  |||  said , he would not entertain relations with colombia 's head of state , nor with its government .
" my dignity does not permit it , " said chávez . he is pushing for a constitutional  |||  reform  |||  on which citizens of the petroleum - exporting country get to vote in a referendum on sunday .
the  |||  reform  |||  would provide a significant extension of his domestic power .
the dispute was caused by uribe 's decision to revoke chávez 's mandate to  |||  negotiate  |||  the release of hostages with marxist rebels in colombia .
uribe 's decision was a " slap in the  |||  face  |||  " for venezuela , chávez had complained on sunday .
chávez is the  |||  talk  |||  of the town in spain , as well .
it was  |||  spoken  |||  by king juan carlos of spain . annoyed by the left - wing populist 's incessant interjections , juan carlos had rebuked him at the most recent ibero - american summit .
despite a  |||  strong  |||  economy , wage earners in germany have to fear a drop in actual wages in 2007 , projections say .
" the causes are a modest wage growth , the value - added tax  |||  increase  |||  and price advances for food and energy , " gustav horn of the institute for macroeconomics and economic research told the daily newspaper " bild . "
on tuesday , it was revealed that exploding prices for  |||  food  |||  and petroleum products were resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years .
venus is earth 's hellish  |||  twin  |||
for almost three  |||  decades  |||  , scientists suspected the existence of lightning on venus .
now , the european probe " venus express " brings confirmation -- it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere : on venus , lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometres , reports christopher russel of the university of california , los angeles , in the science magazine "  |||  nature  |||  . "
according to the  |||  famous  |||  " primordial soup theory , " life on earth was conditioned by lightning : supposedly , thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
not so on venus : " if life  |||  ever  |||  existed there , it had to have been in the planet 's very early history , " explains sean solomon of the carnegie institution , washington .
today , chances of life existing on the surface of venus are slim : the  |||  atmosphere  |||  is about one hundred times denser than on earth , with temperatures of up to 500 degrees .
" venus may be a devilish twin of  |||  earth  |||  , but a twin it is , " russel said .
the key question of the esa mission is why venus , which is so similar to earth in terms of mass and size , has undergone such a fundamentally  |||  different  |||  evolution .
the latest research results are now being presented in several "  |||  nature  |||  " articles . according to the scientists , they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of venus in the solar system .
" they also  |||  show  |||  that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and earth are greater than initially anticipated , " esa reports .
in addition to the  |||  known  |||  whirlwind at the north pole , for instance , the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the south pole , spinning at a significantly higher velocity .
the phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in earth 's winter hemisphere , writes a research team of the  |||  italian  |||  istituto di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica .
the planet , which is also known as morning star or evening star , orbits the sun in just under 225  |||  days  |||  .
its rotation is much slower , however : one venus day equals 243 earth  |||  days  |||  .
water accumulated on both planets . on earth it remained in oceans , whereas on venus it escaped into  |||  space  |||  .
köhler defends merkel 's  |||  meeting  |||  with dalai lama
german federal president köhler is  |||  demanding  |||  an end to the party dispute on the dalai lama 's formal reception at the federal chancellery .
he indirectly criticized the social democratic party because of its attacks on the chancellor after september 's  |||  meeting  |||  .
worried about germany 's reputation ,  |||  german  |||  federal president horst köhler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the dalai lama 's formal reception .
" we should not face the world as a nation that is divided on this  |||  issue  |||  , " köhler told the trade journal " handelsblatt . "
at the same time , köhler signalled his appreciation of the  |||  dalai lama  |||  's formal reception by federal chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , in september .
" i consider human rights to be universal , even though i  |||  respect  |||  the diversity of cultures , " köhler said .
" the  |||  chancellor  |||  has not departed from our traditional policy towards china .
|||  secretary  |||  of state frank - walter steinmeier , a social democrat , had indirectly expressed displeasure at the dalai lama 's formal reception , leading to attacks from the ranks of the christian democratic union .
in the wake of the dalai lama 's formal reception at the federal chancellery , there had been severe discordances in german -  |||  chinese  |||  relations .
for instance , the  |||  chinese  |||  government not only cancelled the inviation to german secretary of the treasury peer steinbrück , a social democrat ; according to news magazine " der spiegel , " it also suspended the so - called strategically dialogue between the two countries ' state departments .
china 's head of government wen jiabao has now asked german federal chancellor angela merkel to concede that the dalai lama 's formal  |||  reception  |||  was a mistake .
stating china 's disapproval of european officials receiving the spiritual leader of the tibetans , wen jiabao underlined the  |||  chinese  |||  position .
the dalai lama 's actions and words showed his intention to  |||  separate  |||  tibet and the broader tibetan region , which also includes other present - day provinces , from china , wen jiabao said .
clashes with the police , shots fired , burning cars : wolfgang schäuble warns of riots  |||  similar  |||  to those in france .
barricades were set aflame and rioters fired shotguns at the police : in the wake of the massive youth riots in france , german federal  |||  secretary  |||  of the interior wolfgang schäuble , of the christian democratic union , fears similar developments in germany .
" we have to prevent the rise of  |||  social  |||  tensions which may escalate in violence .
we need to take this  |||  seriously  |||  , " he told the hannover - based daily newspaper " neue presse . "
federal , state and local governments were already  |||  hard  |||  at work on the issues , said schäuble .
these were not  |||  limited  |||  to the integration of migrants , he added .
" between the german summit for integration and the conference on german -  |||  islamic  |||  affairs , we are beginning to see results . "
at the same time , schäuble pointed out that german suburbs were not suffering from the same urban - construction and sociological  |||  issues  |||  as their french counterparts .
in suburbs north of paris , there had been violent clashes between youths and the  |||  police  |||  in recent nights .
cars and  |||  public  |||  buildings were set on fire in toulouse , as well .
but there was still a need for  |||  action  |||  .
the unemployment  |||  rate  |||  among youths with a migrational background below the age of 25 was " above average , " kolat noted .
" we need to provide options to these youths , " kolat  |||  emphasized  |||  .
in addition , many youths did not want to destroy what their parents had  |||  built  |||  for themselves in germany , he said .
" we still need to be  |||  careful  |||  , " kolat urged .
youths  |||  needed  |||  to be " given the opportunity to participate in labour and education . "
in the parisian suburb villiers - le - bel , the night  |||  remained  |||  quiet , meanwhile .
hundreds of policemen were on alert , and a helicopter circled the  |||  area  |||  with searchlights .
after visiting the suburb , secretary of the interior michelle alliot - marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as  |||  necessary  |||  .
in the following night , the  |||  unrest  |||  encroached upon toulouse .
the riots were ignited by a  |||  traffic  |||  accident which had caused the deaths of two youths on sunday .
according to an initial investigation by the office of the district attorney , the police were not to  |||  blame  |||  in the two youths ' deaths .
after her desolate performance at the bundestag 's  |||  general  |||  debate , which was cloddy and bereft of substance , the verdict is : not this one -- not in the country she ought to be governing .
at the bundestag , she documented , in plain sight of  |||  everyone  |||  , how right on target their criticisms are .
neither a tangible  |||  concern  |||  for , nor any sense of the country 's issues could be detected .
instead , she  |||  presented  |||  herself as angela in the sky : a detached politician who takes refuge in foreign affairs , but remains noncommittal even there .
take , for instance , climate protection : she excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of heiligendamm , but does not share how climate protection objectives are to be  |||  achieved  |||  in this country .
in doing so , she  |||  damages  |||  her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems , instead of sugar - coating the truth .
but in the realm of angela in the sky , domestic  |||  issues  |||  are of marginal importance .
|||  child  |||  poverty and the worries of low - wage earners ?
it is telling how often she misspeaks when it  |||  comes  |||  to children 's allowance .
at this point in her address , merkel  |||  needs  |||  three attempts to produce a reasonably serviceable sentence .
as soon as things  |||  become  |||  concrete , she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground .
|||  attack  |||  department
the candidates ' tension is finding release as early as at the first  |||  subject  |||  .
mitt romney accused his opponent rudy giuliani of turning new york into a " safe haven for  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants . "
the candidates mount the attack : because the republican base still lacks a  |||  clear  |||  favourite , the eight presidential contenders use the cnn debate , first and foremost , to discredit their opponents .
the self - made 30 - second videos submitted via youtube by internet  |||  users  |||  contribute little more than cues .
" this is the kind of isolationism which  |||  allowed  |||  hitler to rise to power , " john mccain accuses opponent ron paul , the only one in the group demanding an instant withdrawal from iraq .
however , audience reactions in st. petersburg , florida ,  |||  show  |||  that the important issues of the campaign are far off from the iraq war and the torture debates .
" i was wrong back then , " a remorseful romney announces , apologizing to  |||  base  |||  and audience for having endorsed abortion as recently as in 1994 .
giuliani faltered when asked about his  |||  opinion  |||  on taking the bible literally , meanwhile .
one day after resigning as army chief ,  |||  pakistani  |||  ruler musharraf was sworn in as president .
thus , eight years of  |||  military  |||  rule in pakistan came to an end .
on thursday , president pervez musharraf was sworn in for  |||  another  |||  five - year term in office .
the ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital islamabad was broadcast  |||  live  |||  on pakistani television .
musharraf vowed to honour the constitution and to act towards the good of the  |||  nation  |||  .
on wednesday , he had consigned the office of army chief to his confidant ashfaq kiyani , yielding to international pressure , by the us in  |||  particular  |||  .
eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup , the former  |||  general  |||  now for the first time reigns as a civilian head of state .
by stepping down as commander - in - chief of the armed  |||  forces  |||  , musharraf had complied with one of the key demands of the opposition and of the west .
ending the state of  |||  emergency  |||  , which musharraf had declared on november 3 , is another central demand .
according to attorney general malik muhammad qayyum , musharraf will revoke the state of emergency soon after being sworn in , and by doing so  |||  meet  |||  another of the demands of the west .
last week , the country 's supreme court had overruled all objections to the head of state 's controversial re - election on october 6. after declaring a state of  |||  emergency  |||  , musharraf had filled it with jurisprudents who were well - disposed towards him .
in the northern tribal area of north waziristan , four soldiers were  |||  killed  |||  and four more harmed in an attack on a military convoy , meanwhile .
according to an army spokesman , the bomb exploded on a road  |||  near  |||  the afghanistan border .
the fathers of krautrock are  |||  back  |||
germany 's super group of the seventies is reunited : at a concert in berlin , the three band  |||  members  |||  of harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles .
at his  |||  left  |||  flank is michael rother , a paltry 57 , wielding a laptop computer and a guitar .
each of them is contributing noises ,  |||  sometimes  |||  even a beat .
the gentlemen themselves do not  |||  seem  |||  overly bothered when it does , either .
the  |||  band  |||  harmonia 's reunion has caused some excitement among krautrock aficionados .
although , it may be disclosed here : specific inquiries uncovered that while the  |||  name  |||  was buzzing through collective pop memory , it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years .
but why should germans not be allowed to celebrate their  |||  living  |||  legends from the seventies , too ?
at shows later on , michael rother sat on  |||  stage  |||  with the red hot chili peppers , like an old pal .
the problem with the  |||  ignorance  |||  at home and a misty - eyed view abroad is one thing .
harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only , making much less of an impression in that period than  |||  others  |||  would attest in hindsight .
rother had briefly helped out kraftwerk , and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with neu ! , at the time perhaps the most radical  |||  german  |||  group .
there , at the alte weserhof , an old ruin dating to the 16th century , they lived as communards , away from the  |||  cities  |||  .
less ideologically than at kommune i , where roedelius had  |||  once  |||  laboured as a nanny .
but rather  |||  living  |||  the spitzwegian life of an artist .
|||  allegedly  |||  , a banneret of the glee club harmonia ottenstein was found amid some scrap , and thus , a name for their art .
the first album was called " musik von harmonia , " the  |||  next  |||  one " de luxe . "
the newly released cd " live 1974 " was recorded at a concert in griessem , in front of a  |||  record  |||  audience of 50 , as somebody seems to recall .
cluster became fashionable again in the eighties , and went on to be more successful than harmonia  |||  ever  |||  was .
the griessem  |||  live  |||  album is owed to herbert grönemeyer .
his record label grönland aims to preserve krautrock as germany 's own distinct  |||  contribution  |||  to lively music .
the in - the - flesh resurrection of harmonia takes place at the berlin  |||  house  |||  of cultures of the world .
|||  publicly  |||  funded , as part of the worldtronics festival .
along with the idiosyncratic sound , brian eno 's dictum is hovering in the room : " the only  |||  true  |||  music , the future belongs to it . "
projections of  |||  further  |||  black - and - white photos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend .
in front of it all , the three veterans are  |||  once again  |||  improvising .
krautrock , after all , has always been a very english  |||  term  |||  .
it never was  |||  rock  |||  .
on the  |||  stage  |||  , even the most self - evident things are considered most thoroughly .
where does music  |||  start  |||  , and when does it end ?
it can wreck your  |||  nerves  |||  , or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness .
richard gere just is n't cynical  |||  enough  |||
" the hunting party " and " mörderischer frieden " make two more films dealing with the  |||  balkan  |||  war .
but neither of them is  |||  convincing  |||  .
even richard gere , in " the hunting  |||  party  |||  , " ca n't change that .
the good news first : war criminals karadzic and mladic may still be hiding in the balkan mountains . but  |||  right  |||  there , of all places , in the dark hinterland of the bosnian war , the actor richard gere has now been recovered .
we had  |||  lost  |||  sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately , after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel - good films for women and all too many press conferences on buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him .
now , suddenly , richard gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch " the hunting party , " after all . ( the full german title is " the hunting party -- wenn der jäger zum gejagten wird " - why do film titles always have to be as  |||  long  |||  and dizzying over here as labour agreements for engine drivers ? )
his  |||  performance  |||  is delightfully tongue - in - cheek . essentially , his war reporter simon hunt is who gere could have ended up as , had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him : a man whose heyday is long past , but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin - like monument .
still , despite this trump card , " the hunting party , " along with the german production " mörderischer frieden , " which also debuts this week , merely continues the endless line of  |||  failed  |||  balkan war movies .
" mörderischer frieden " can be dealt with fairly quickly : the film is about two german soldiers in kosovo ( adrian topol , max riemelt ) who rescue a serbian woman from kosovan snipers - and one of  |||  whom  |||  promptly falls in love with her , to boot .
what  |||  remains  |||  is something like the german car - chase tv show " alarm für cobra 11 , " only with war taking the place of the autobahn .
" the hunting party , " meanwhile , is kind of like exhibit a in the investigation on why there 's actually never been a really good  |||  balkan  |||  war movie .
with another director and another screenwriter ( richard shepard is both ) , and at another time , the story of three us war reporters committed to track down serbian war  |||  criminal  |||  supreme " the fox " might have ended up becoming a new " apocalypse now . "
the stories , after all , are strikingly  |||  similar  |||  : in both , small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military could n't , and in both , the result is a journey into madness .
" the hunting party " goes off the rails altogether when the reporters , in fast - forward motion , achieve in the last five minutes what nato , cia and all the bounty hunters in the world have n't been able to achieve in five years : to catch the war criminal and  |||  leave  |||  him to the just revenge of the bosnian muslims .
this is so bad , it makes you want to appeal to the international  |||  court  |||  of justice at the hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic .
the film 's concern , however , is actually a deeply  |||  human  |||  one .
|||  recently  |||  , it was reported in this paper that all hollywood iraq movies have utterly bombed .
one could add : there has never been a good  |||  south africa  |||  movie , either .
some film or other may still mature -- the vietnam works " the deer hunter , " " apocalypse now " or " full metal jacket , " now  |||  considered  |||  to be classics , were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time , after all .
or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays , with every instance of  |||  mass  |||  murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously .
and that robs screenwriters of the recklessness  |||  required  |||  to tell good stories .
part of the reason why " to be or not to be " or " the great dictator " are such good films , after all , is that lubitsch and chaplin did n't yet know how bad the  |||  nazi  |||  regime 's reign really was .
to be able to make good  |||  films  |||  , perhaps one must not want to be good .
perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic  |||  view  |||  like the novelist lawrence norfolk 's is required .
queried on the parallels between his  |||  historical  |||  novel " lemprière 's dictionary " and the balkan war , he replied : " that 's just because some things never change .
von beust criticized on  |||  olympics  |||  withdrawal
many intend to  |||  keep  |||  fighting for the waterfront games .
on wednesday , hans - jörg schmidt - trenz , managing director of the hamburg chamber of commerce ,  |||  described  |||  the withdrawal as being " not good for the economic area . "
" without that goal , the current sporting - politics momentum could not be  |||  maintained  |||  to this degree . "
mayor ole von beust insisted on  |||  earlier  |||  statements on wednesday , saying that hamburg 's olympic ambitions were unrealistic , at least before the year 2028 .
" it 's the  |||  german  |||  olympic sports confederation that has to decide on an application for the olympics , not hamburg , " von beust told " welt online . "
" what this preference means for us is that we wo n't have a  |||  realistic  |||  chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028 . "
they created the impression that hamburg did not intend to apply for olympic games for the  |||  next  |||  25 years , it was said .
" it 's premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such an early stage , " hsb  |||  president  |||  günter ploß said on wednesday .
further , withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the  |||  head  |||  of senate on the occasion of a reception at a plenary meeting of the german university sports confederation , ploß added .
the university sports confederation had nominated hamburg as a candidate for application as recently as  |||  last  |||  week .
" the senate delayed the development of kleiner grasbrook for years , because it had put all its eggs in the olympics basket and neglected housing  |||  construction  |||  , " said social democratic delegates carola veit and jan quast .
the application for the 2012 summer olympic games had  |||  generated  |||  much excitement in hamburg at the time .
those are n't warhol 's  |||  boxes  |||
connecting the  |||  terms  |||  " sweden " and " wooden box " makes one think of ikea , rather than andy warhol .
|||  currently  |||  , wooden boxes manufactured in sweden are casting dark shadows on warhol 's catalogue of work .
after swedish newspaper " expressen " had cast doubt on the authenticity of andy warhol 's 1968 brillo boxes several months ago , an internal investigation at the moderna museet , stockholm , now comes to a sobering conclusion : the six " brillo boxes " donated to the moderna museet by  |||  former  |||  museum director pontus hultén in 1995 are forgeries -- as , presumably , are the bulk of the nearly hundred further extant brillo boxes of the " type stockholm " in circulation on the international art market .
in 1964 , andy warhol created his first " brillo boxes " in new york : painted  |||  wooden  |||  boxes based on the red , white and blue design of the " brillo " soap cardboard boxes .
they were n't works of art , but their models --  |||  mere  |||  sample pieces .
simultaneously , warhol  |||  apparently  |||  consented to the production of a small number of wooden brillo boxes in sweden in 1968 , which , however , were not exhibited at the moderna museet .
contemporary witnesses now  |||  speak  |||  of approximately fifteen boxes which made art and auction history as original andy warhol brillo boxes with the designation " type stockholm " back then , and rightly so .
the problem , now , is that legendary museum director pontus hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were  |||  produced  |||  and exhibited in sweden in 1968 , and subsequently consigned to him by warhol .
as a matter of fact , however , hultén 's 105 boxes were not  |||  produced  |||  until 1990 in malmö , for an exhibition in st. petersburg .
at that point in time , warhol had already been  |||  dead  |||  for three years .
the  |||  structure  |||  of the 1990 facsimiles reveals , however , that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming -- and , further , that it was n't oil paint , but acrylic .
" these boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of andy warhol 's brillo boxes , " says lars nittwe , director of the moderna museet . " unless the andy warhol art authentication board in new york arrives at a  |||  different  |||  conclusion , the moderna museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as facsimiles / sample pieces . "
of course , the authentication  |||  board  |||  had already announced an investigation into the " grave allegations " made in the case of the soapboxes back in july .
however , it has been shrouded in adamant  |||  silence  |||  ever since .
in the phillipines , renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in manila and  |||  demanding  |||  the overthrow of president gloria macapagal arroyo .
|||  earlier  |||  , government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas .
they seized the peninsula hotel ,  |||  demanding  |||  president gloria macapagal arroyo to be overthrown .
troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area  |||  surrounding  |||  the posh hotel .
the president called for an  |||  emergency  |||  meeting of the national security cabinet .
national security adviser norberto gonzales  |||  condemned  |||  the soldiers ' actions .
other military units were to join the march shortly , said  |||  general  |||  danilo lim , former leader of the scout rangers elite unit .

|||  united  |||  internet has secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company versatel .
|||  options  |||  to increase its holding of versatel were being kept open , the company said .
according to united internet , the move is intended to advance the consolidation of the  |||  german  |||  dsl market .
earlier on wednesday , there had already been speculation about an acquisition of shares after berenberg bank had  |||  increased  |||  its participation in the düsseldorf network operator by another five percent , to 15.1 percent .
the bank was merely  |||  holding  |||  the shares for a third party , rumours in the financial market suggested .
on the previous day , united internet had already bought into  |||  mobile  |||  telecommunications operator drillisch with around ten percent .
in the context of a capital  |||  increase  |||  , drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares , with a total value of 106.4 million euros .
of those ,  |||  united  |||  internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total .
further , the companies are in talks over  |||  marketing  |||  cooperations for dsl and mobile telecommunications products .
" we are strengthening our partnership , " a spokesman for  |||  united  |||  internet explained .
for the time being , the two companies will settle for a share of approximately ten percent and not make use of their option to buy  |||  another  |||  18.49 percent of freenet , united internet announced on thursday .
however , the two companies were keeping all their options open , especially with a view to  |||  increasing  |||  their share of freenet ag , it was said .
talks between  |||  united  |||  internet and freenet about a strategic partnership had been aborted in mid - november .
the months - long and at this stage fairly unclear power struggle over freenet is part of the consolidation of the  |||  german  |||  telecommunication market .
the holding of united internet and drillisch has , so far , directly  |||  held  |||  6.01 percent of freenet shares .
now , it had been arranged for drillisch to acquire  |||  another  |||  four percent , it was said .
the option to buy 18.49 percent from  |||  investment  |||  company vatas had already been arranged back in august .
prague stock market falls to minus by the end of the  |||  trading  |||  day
after a sharp drop in the morning , the prague  |||  stock market  |||  corrected its losses .
transactions with stocks from the czech energy enterprise ( čez )  |||  reached  |||  nearly half of the regular daily trading .
this time the fall in  |||  stocks  |||  on wall street is responsible for the drop .
the reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the american house of representatives , which refused to  |||  support  |||  the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there , has manifested itself here as well .
stocks  |||  fall  |||  in asia
stocks in the asian markets  |||  experienced  |||  a dramatic drop on tuesday , even though the indexes ultimately erased a part of the losses during the day .
the hang seng china enterprises index , which follows the movement of  |||  chinese  |||  stocks on the stock market in hong kong , dropped by 3.8 percent , in shanghai the markets were closed .
the stock exchange in taiwan  |||  dropped  |||  by 3.6 percent according to the local index .
" the timing of the bailout  |||  action  |||  in the usa is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world , " remarked the head of the hong kong currency board , joseph yam .
despite the fact that it is a part of china , hong kong determines its currency policy separately , that is , without being dependent on the  |||  chinese  |||  central bank .
hong kong has  |||  interest  |||  rates at the same level as the united states .
american legislators should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system , according to australian  |||  prime minister  |||  kevin rudd .
otherwise there reputedly looms the threat that other countries will also  |||  feel  |||  the impacts .
|||  american  |||  stock bloodbath
on monday the american house of representatives  |||  rejected  |||  the plan to support the financial system , into which up to 700 billion dollars ( nearly 12 billion czech crowns ) was to be invested .
the legislators thus ignored president george bush 's  |||  appeal  |||  for them to support the plan .
american stocks suffered a bloodbath on monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest  |||  fall  |||  in more than 20 years .
the index had dropped even prior to the vote , but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the house , the index went into free  |||  fall  |||  .
congress yields : us  |||  government  |||  can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
the top representatives of the american congress and george w. bush 's cabinet have  |||  agreed  |||  upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the american financial system .
the vote on it will take place at the beginning of  |||  next  |||  week .
|||  american  |||  legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the american financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars ( approximately 12 billion crowns ) .
that is , the members of congress have to  |||  complete  |||  some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it .
the plan to support the financial system will be  |||  discussed  |||  in the house of representatives on monday .
the chair of the financial services committee , barney  |||  frank  |||  , told reuters this on sunday .
sources say that the senate could evidently  |||  vote  |||  on the plan on wednesday at the soonest .
economists say that the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor  |||  significant  |||  to the revival of financial markets .
afterward , however , a " sobering up " will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in  |||  practice  |||  .
paulson : plan must be  |||  effective  |||
" we 've made great  |||  progress  |||  .
we 've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should  |||  look  |||  , " democrat nancy pelosi told bloomberg .
representatives of the legislators met with american finance minister henry paulson saturday night in  |||  order  |||  to give the government fund a final form .
the fund is meant to purchase unsellable mortgage assets which are pulling financial companies down into  |||  heavy  |||  losses and are endangering the stability of the entire system .
" we 're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be  |||  effective  |||  on the market .
it 's necessary to continue in the curative  |||  plan  |||  , but i think we 're there , " paulson said .
a signal for asian  |||  trading  |||
the global financial crisis is significantly impacting the  |||  stock  |||  markets , which are dropping sharply .
namely , by doing this they want to calm investors prior to  |||  trading  |||  on the asian financial markets , which , given their time zones , are the first ones where the decision by congress could influence monday 's trading .
in the meantime , however , it is not yet  |||  clear  |||  with any certainty when both chambers of the american congress will vote on the bill , nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem .
the legislators hope that it will be  |||  approved  |||  in the next few days .
however , the bill will still go through a series of  |||  changes  |||  .
the total  |||  amount  |||  designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts .
the initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible , as  |||  requested  |||  by president george bush .
but congress can block the release of the remaining amount , in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later , the  |||  final  |||  350 billion dollars , if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function .
|||  bush  |||  appreciates progress in negotiations
|||  though  |||  the president can veto this decision , congress can override his veto .
even in spite of these changes , the  |||  essential  |||  idea of the program , to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks , the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of americans were unable to pay off their mortgages , has remained intact .
the  |||  house  |||  of representatives should be able to vote on the bill on sunday and the senate on monday , " said republican senator judd gregg .
even  |||  american  |||  president bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations .
his speaker tony fratto declared that bush was satisfied with saturday 's progress and appreciated the " two - party effort to stabilize our financial markets and  |||  save  |||  our economy " .
constraining  |||  golden  |||  parachutes
the chairman of the senate banking committee , christopher dodd , the chief negotiator , said that the legislators had  |||  agreed  |||  upon the responsibilities for the financial program , protection of the taxpayers against losses , closing of relief packages , and timing of the financial plan .
" we 've  |||  worked  |||  very hard on this and we 've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all americans , " paulson said .
the plan also includes assistance to  |||  homeowners  |||  who have problems making their payments .
marek : psychological  |||  help  |||
according to the chief economist of patria finance , david marek , the  |||  proposed  |||  plan is a good idea , but its realization will be very difficult .
" and this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what  |||  price  |||  the problematic assets will be bought .
this will determine how the financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses amongst  |||  themselves  |||  , " marek told the server ihned.cz this week .
whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so  |||  significant  |||  , according to marek .
" more important is for the members of congress to  |||  agree  |||  this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible .
the  |||  psychological  |||  significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time , " marek emphasized .
our advice on how to  |||  choose  |||
while nearly  |||  every  |||  cell phone can play mp 3 files , no mp 3 player can make phone calls .
in spite of this , there are many reasons to get a  |||  separate  |||  mp 3 player .
the choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future  |||  owner  |||  .
it is not likely that you will get a top - of - the - line  |||  expensive  |||  record player in order to listen to the newest album by maxim turbulenc .
first of all such  |||  music  |||  products not available on lps , but also , from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it .
however , if your shelves are crowded with art rock , jazz , or blues vinyl records , you are likely at  |||  least  |||  dreaming of a record player like that .
it 's the same with  |||  music  |||  on trips , that is , compressed music , simply put , mp 3 music .
there are  |||  price  |||  and qualitative categories here as well .
two extremes , between which there is  |||  enough  |||  space for everyone .
the selection is  |||  broad  |||  .
battery life also  |||  decides  |||
some top - of - the - line music players can do much more than merely  |||  play  |||  music , but also what most cell phones ca n't even do by chance .
no contemporary machine is as  |||  universal  |||  as the telephone .
and when we take smart phones and communication devices , you have a small  |||  computer  |||  in your pocket .
it 's a  |||  small  |||  miracle , as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures .
the universal nature of the cell phone also brings  |||  disadvantages  |||  .
the more  |||  functions  |||  you use on your cell phone , the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger .
and playing music is one of the biggest  |||  energy  |||  guzzlers .
in this way , music players ( particularly the simplest ones ) are much more  |||  efficient  |||  .
which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not  |||  play  |||  for more than a few hours .
you wo n't have this problem with mp 3 players , even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours  |||  running  |||  on one charge .
|||  another  |||  problem arises when recording music on the cell phone .
for the music players , with some exceptions ( ipod ) , you do n't need any  |||  special  |||  software .
it 's enough to fill the device with music using the usb from the  |||  computer  |||  .
most cell phones and music players already create a music library by  |||  themselves  |||  , organized according to the artist 's name , album title , genre , or , e.g. , user rating .
some devices only display the tree structure of the directory ,  |||  similar  |||  to windows explorer and some are able to do both ( iriver , samsung , sony , cowon , smart phones with an operating systems ) .
music players  |||  easier  |||  to service , cell phones can do more
if music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only  |||  going  |||  to listen to it for a little while , perhaps in the tram , any cell phone which plays mp 3 is enough .
you do n't even have to pay too much attention to which  |||  music  |||  formats the cell phone or music player can handle .
the mp 3 can handle all of them , and in fact , most of the  |||  music  |||  you will get will be in this very format .
|||  less  |||  common is the appearance of aac ( the format used by the apple company and its ipods ) .
better cell phones , at the same time ,  |||  enable  |||  the purchase of music on - line .
all you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator ( or  |||  another  |||  provider ) using mobile internet .
unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast - growing  |||  radio  |||  hits .
it is generally  |||  assumed  |||  , however , that this very manner of music sales ( whether using gsm , the internet or wireless internet ) will take over the music industry in the future .
whenever you feel like listening to something , you can  |||  reach  |||  for your cell phone in your pocket , while the mp 3 player lies at home , forgotten .
however , it still  |||  depends  |||  on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands - free with you .
if not , you can utilize the  |||  integrated  |||  speaker that is in almost all cell phones , but only in a minimum of mp 3 players .
but the greatest advantage of the  |||  music  |||  cell phones for many people is the price .
the least expensive of them regularly  |||  cost  |||  less than three thousand crowns .
for three or  |||  four  |||  thousand crowns , you can get a very decent walkman .
usually , however , you 'll be limited by the absence of output on  |||  ordinary  |||  headphones .
the best and most technically well - equipped telephones , with a 3.5 mm jack for  |||  ordinary  |||  headphones , cost up to fifteen thousand crowns .
anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive ( see our  |||  selection  |||  ) - music players .
even the least expensive cell phones ( e.g. vodafone 527 ) generally have a slot for replaceable  |||  memory  |||  cards ( of the type m 2 , microsd and the like ) .
even with the additional purchase of the  |||  respective  |||  card , you will spend less than two thousand crowns .
with the basic models , only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 gb tend to be  |||  supported  |||  .
based on capacity ( maximum 2 gb ) you do n't have to  |||  spend  |||  more than 1,100 crowns .
these devices have separate control buttons for mp 3 and the user - friendly nature of their operation is  |||  close  |||  to that of a separate mp 3 player .
sony ericsson , whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the mp 3 players  |||  sold  |||  separately , is the most advanced in the field .
the mp 3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns , but with a greater memory  |||  capacity  |||  ( up to 16 gb ) and battery endurance ( normally 15 hours , maximally up to 35 hours ) .
first virtual operator to  |||  arrive  |||  in czechia this year .
|||  maybe  |||
in spite of this , there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the  |||  classic  |||  operators to lower their prices .
we have already written many times on mobil.cz about the fact that czech  |||  operators  |||  are among the most expensive in europe .
this has also been confirmed by the czech telecommunications bureau , who called attention to the fact that the  |||  price  |||  of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the union .
following the most recent steps taken by the european commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees , a paradoxical situation may  |||  occur  |||  - text messages for some customers of czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home .
the answer is  |||  simple  |||  , there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle .
|||  perhaps  |||  it sounds paradoxical , after all , we have three mobile networks here and over 100 % coverage .
mobile operators , on the other hand , like to pretend that the czech market is extremely  |||  competitive  |||  .
this is often seconded by the chairman of the council of the czech telecommunications bureau ( ctb ) pavel dvořák , who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for  |||  another  |||  operator in czechia .
but there is one more opportunity - a virtual  |||  operator  |||  .
it is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the  |||  significant  |||  lowering of prices , to which even the classic operators had to react .
at the same time , even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as tesco mobile or virgin mobile , voices  |||  similar  |||  to those here could be heard .
but it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly  |||  successful  |||  .
for that matter , we do n't have to go far to find  |||  examples  |||  .
in february of this year , we informed you of the  |||  start  |||  of the virtual operator mobilking in poland .
over the course of merely half a year , this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and  |||  become  |||  the fifth largest operator .
at the same time , the financial group penta , which owns , among  |||  others  |||  , u:fon , stands behind mobilking .
the advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more  |||  specific  |||  target group .
in  |||  order  |||  to function effectively , they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does .
that is , they do not carry the relatively  |||  high  |||  costs of construction , operation and maintenance of a mobile network .
that 's how , for example , tesco mobile in great britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its  |||  competitors  |||  .
but as the example of mobilking in poland shows , it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel  |||  target  |||  group .
that is , this  |||  operator  |||  is specifically oriented toward men .
" real men  |||  choose  |||  mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust , " says david seibert , the ceo of mobile entertainment company , which runs this virtual operator .
it is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in poland could  |||  catch  |||  on here .
miroslav čepický , spokesman for vodafone , doubts this : " the czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual  |||  operators  |||  are founded .
in addition , it 's relatively saturated from the perspective of the  |||  offer  |||  of services . "
no chance in czechia , say mobile  |||  operators  |||
it seems almost  |||  certain  |||  that if there is to be a virtual operator in czechia , it wo n't be mobilking .
" we have been  |||  talking  |||  about the expansion of this successful project , but the negotiations in czechia do n't look very hopeful .
more likely , mobilking will be  |||  launched  |||  in other countries in our region , " said jana studničková , speaker for the penta financial group , in a telephone interview for mobil.cz .
she also confirmed indirectly that the  |||  current  |||  mobile operators in czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea .
rather , on the contrary , they are  |||  trying  |||  to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence .
for a longer period of time now , the gts novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator , and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a  |||  real  |||  competitor of telefonica o 2 in the area of corporate clientele .
" we are very interested in being able to  |||  offer  |||  our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services , but also mobile ones .
the sooner , the  |||  better  |||  .
we have held  |||  repeated  |||  negotiations on this possibility with all czech mobile operators .
we have already been able to make  |||  progress  |||  in the negotiations with some of them , " said the group 's spokesman , pavel kaidl .
in the meantime , however , its  |||  creation  |||  is accompanied by a wall of silence .
" at this time , we do not think that there is  |||  space  |||  for the creation of a full - fledged virtual operator .
compared to other markets , the czech market is very  |||  specific  |||  .
no subject has approached us thus far with a complex and  |||  serious  |||  project in this area , " claimed vlastimil sršeň from the public relations department of telefonica 02 in a statement for mobil.cz .
vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3g  |||  license  |||  .
regarding this , miroslav čepický said : " we are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , above all in the area of  |||  shared  |||  costs and infrastructure .
from the  |||  perspective  |||  of the customers , we consider this to be the most beneficial .
vodafone 's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a  |||  shared  |||  network for fast mobile internet . "
|||  responsible  |||  authorities - buddy - buddy with operators
the procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand , the entrance of another operator would mean  |||  increased  |||  competition , it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits .
probably the greatest pressure on the czech telecommunication office was during the time of the creation of u:fon by t -  |||  mobile  |||  .
but now this is a suitable argument for u:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual  |||  operator  |||  .
regarding that matter , martina kemrová pointed out : " the  |||  competitive  |||  environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market .
|||  considering  |||  the character of the mobile market in the czech republic , it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services . "
but  |||  considering  |||  this approach by the mobile operators , the lack of interest by the czech regulatory organs is , in fact , startling .
this means not only the attitude of the cto , which unfortunately in czechia - unlike in great britain and other  |||  developed  |||  countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition .
this authority belongs to the office for the protection of  |||  competition  |||  ( opc ) exclusively .
but this office has assumed its typical position on this whole  |||  issue  |||  .
" the entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the  |||  necessary  |||  infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator .
no such contract has ever been signed , because the  |||  supply  |||  of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators , " claimed kristián chalupa from the external relations department of the opc in his answer to our question .
a statement  |||  formulated  |||  in that way by representatives of the operators probably wo n't surprise anyone .
from the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and , among other things , make sure that no one abuses his / her  |||  position  |||  on the market , it is more than serious .
but evidently the pressure on the  |||  proper  |||  functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the opc .
in truth , the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile  |||  operators  |||  that is implicit in their reactions .
the question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises  |||  entirely  |||  by itself .
" the office did not find any  |||  signs  |||  of actions violating the rules of competition , and thus has no reason to intervene in any way .
none of the operators have a dominant position , and hence none of them have the corresponding  |||  increased  |||  responsibility for their actions on the market .
the telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to  |||  open  |||  the mobile market for the virtual operators , " chalupa claimed in his statement .
the interpretation of the dominant  |||  position  |||  on the market is one of the disputed points .
of course , an analysis of the  |||  relevant  |||  markets does exist , conducted by cto , according to which telecommunications are , from the perspective of competition , the only market .
on such a market , none of the czech operators then have a dominant  |||  position  |||  .
but some legal experts offer a  |||  different  |||  perspective - in order to create a virtual operator , it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator .
and the mobile  |||  operator  |||  - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network .
so in a certain segment , it must necessarily be  |||  dominant  |||  .
but even if we did not consider this argument , for the opc it could be at least alarming that the three mobile  |||  operators  |||  are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner .
at the same time , complaints from a series of interested parties ( including the gts novera company mentioned above )  |||  demonstrate  |||  that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators .
placing the responsibility on the cto is a rather common trick in telecommunications , through which the opc can have nothing to do with the whole  |||  matter  |||  .
we have already encountered it in several  |||  similar  |||  cases .
the representatives of the opc must know this very well , but their interests are evidently  |||  elsewhere  |||  .
at the same time , the functioning of some pseudo - virtual operators , of which there are already several in  |||  czech  |||  mobile networks , remains unnoticed .
these are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services , which are only partially  |||  public  |||  .
these are usually companies dealing with multilevel  |||  marketing  |||  .
for example , amway , bohemia telecom , starlife and a number of others  |||  offer  |||  their own mobile telephone services .
the price lists of these  |||  companies  |||  usually only reach selected individuals .
the trick lies in the fact that , in relation to the operator , the company  |||  acts  |||  like a classic company client who orders a great amount of sim cards .
as a  |||  significant  |||  client , it then gets special price offers ( and other types of offers ) .
the problem is that the trading conditions of all czech mobile  |||  operators  |||  prohibit such advance sales .
but it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the  |||  responsible  |||  people from the mobile operators .
this could be a question of thousands of customers , above all in the case of the three  |||  companies  |||  mentioned above .
but at the same time , none of the  |||  operators  |||  are opposed to such a procedure .
namely , they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the  |||  real  |||  virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing .
miroslav čepický draws attention to  |||  potential  |||  problems : " the law enables such speculation , nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies .
on top of that , they must  |||  accept  |||  that the sim card in their telephone is not registered under their name , and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can . "
this is precisely what should seem at least  |||  strange  |||  to the cto .
in addition ,  |||  another  |||  question for the opc arises .
if the mobile  |||  operators  |||  are looking the other way concerning this procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ?
at the same time , classical operators have more or less tried to  |||  prevent  |||  the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created .
the arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too  |||  small  |||  , too saturated , problems with the quality of services , etc.
but in  |||  developed  |||  countries , the regulatory organs , which supported the interests not of the mobile operators , but of their customers , intervened at that very moment .
either through formal measures or informal pressure , they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator , and  |||  others  |||  continued in its footsteps .
unfortunately , the czech  |||  regulatory  |||  organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato .
if the behind - the - scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon , the czech mobile market  |||  might  |||  be set in motion once again .
if one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , it will be difficult for opc to be able to  |||  remain  |||  indifferent to the refusal ( discrimination ) of further interested parties .
and we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of  |||  europe  |||  .
new  |||  czech  |||  national anthem has four new versions .
|||  choose  |||  the best one
listen to the four renderings of the new version of the czech  |||  national  |||  anthem .
on sunday prime minister mirek topolánek  |||  presented  |||  the new recordings of the national anthem kde domov můj ( where is my country ) on the occasion of the day of czech statehood .
the anthem was newly recorded by the  |||  national  |||  theater orchestra under the direction of jiří bělohlávek .
kateřina kněžínková and  |||  adam  |||  plachetka did the singing .
you can  |||  listen  |||  to all four versions on the server ihned.cz .
he told czech radio earlier that he had intentionally selected singers with young , representative voices that were striking and  |||  popular  |||  for the solo variants .
" from the beginning , with both of them and also with the chorus , i tried to make sure that they had clear articulation , so that the text could be  |||  understood  |||  well , so that they were in harmony , " he said .
the czech  |||  national  |||  anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year .
the song kde domov můj ( where is my country ) was heard for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the estates theater in the original czech  |||  play  |||  fidlovačka by josef kajetán tyl with the music of františek škroup .
it gained popularity and the people spontaneously  |||  took  |||  it as their own .
the first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the  |||  national  |||  anthem following the creation of czechoslovakia in 1918 .
it  |||  remained  |||  one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent czech republic .
the roughly one  |||  hundred  |||  thousand people in possession of their own chip card opencard at this time can get this coupon .
travellers can buy a 30 - day , 90 - day and year - long coupon ( which will be  |||  valid  |||  beginning on january 1 , 2009 ) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the transport company at the metro stations muzeum , můstek , nádraží holešovice , anděl , roztyly , letňany , kobylisy , rajská zahrada , kačerov and luka .
beginning yesterday , coupons can also be purchased over the internet on the web pages of the  |||  transport  |||  company , www.dpp.cz .
by the afternoon , more than four hundred  |||  customers  |||  had used the service .
they are red , resembling ticket validation machines , and travellers  |||  might  |||  have already noticed them in the metro stations roztyly , budějovická , i. p. pavlova , florenc and vltavská .
" now there are five of them in the city , but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them , " opatrný  |||  added  |||  .
coupon checked by self - service machine instead of  |||  driver  |||
using the self - service machines , which will  |||  begin  |||  functioning tomorrow , is simple .
the electronic coupons are  |||  valid  |||  beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city , but in its surroundings as well .
upon boarding , it is thus necessary to not only  |||  show  |||  the chip card to the driver , but in addition it is necessary to place the opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register .
this is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons  |||  recorded  |||  .
" if the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons  |||  recorded  |||  , there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver , " drápal added .
travelers who do not use suburban buses , and will not  |||  remember  |||  when the validity of a coupon ends , can head again for the self - service machines where the coupons are added to the card .
sudetenlands  |||  wanted  |||  referendum from usa
sudeten germans  |||  requested  |||  that the šumava region be incorporated into the united states in 1945 .
if we cannot be a part of germany or austria , we wish at least to  |||  live  |||  under the patronage of the united states .
several groups of sudeten germans supposedly addressed the president of the usa with a  |||  wish  |||  of this type .
this arises from , among other things , a letter which has been preserved in a  |||  private  |||  archive and is now stored in the collections of the south bohemia research library .
in the letter , germans from český krumlov request that the american president not to allow the  |||  return  |||  of the " šumava region " - occupied by hitler on the basis of the munich agreement - to czechoslovakia .
" we have  |||  understood  |||  the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the american troops are entering german territory not as oppressors and enemies , but rather , as liberators , " is what is written in the letter , signed " people who are not indifferent to the fate of šumava " .
since the annexation by czechoslovakia supposedly only gives the sudeten germans hope for - knowing the czech national character - brutality , disregard , lack of understanding , oppression and slavery , the authors of the letter ask the  |||  american  |||  president to take over the protectorate of šumava forever .
" we cannot  |||  believe  |||  that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people , you would award this territory to a state foreign to us , which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing , absolutely nothing , to the victory of the allies , " is written in the letter .
the reason why the authors could not  |||  sign  |||  their names was the supposed fear of revenge by the " czech oppressors " .
if the president of the usa were to supposedly have doubts about the persuasion of the šumava germans , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the šumava region on whether its inhabitants want to  |||  become  |||  a part of the usa or live under the patronage of the united states .
though the text of the letter may  |||  sound  |||  a bit naïve given the contemporary knowledge of post - war history , according to some witnesses it appropriately sketches the expectations of the sudeten germans at that time .
even  |||  though  |||  the czech germans had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discussed , almost none of them admitted this possibility at all .
some expected that the united states and great britain would negotiate a  |||  certain  |||  type of autonomy for the sudetenlands .
|||  others  |||  believed that they would simply remain in czechoslovakia .
the  |||  famous  |||  journalist gustav chalupa , born in české budějovice , also confirms this .
as a  |||  german  |||  from české budějovice , he was sent to the navy in the baltic sea during the war .
" they believed that when they returned  |||  home  |||  , czech would come in handy , " chalupa said .
according to him , none of the german prisoners  |||  living  |||  in czechoslovakia before the war envisaged being displaced from the republic on the basis of the beneš decrees .
emotive campaign attacks  |||  drivers  |||
the most expensive  |||  action  |||  aimed at safety on the roads in czech history .
that 's also one way to characterize the emotive  |||  media  |||  campaign which the ministry of transportation plans to launch on wednesday .
the office of  |||  minister  |||  aleš řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel .
the 150 - million - crown campaign will  |||  appear  |||  on television , on the radio , in cinemas , on the internet , but also on flyers .
it should discourage drivers from speeding and  |||  driving  |||  under the influence of alcohol .
and also remind them to fasten their seatbelts  |||  before  |||  they start driving .
above all , it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers , motorcyclists , pedestrians , and last but not least ,  |||  professional  |||  drivers .
mainly  |||  human  |||  stories that attack the emotions .
and even the "  |||  bloody  |||  " slogan of the whole campaign attests to this :
the words " you do n't think " are  |||  written  |||  in capital letters on a license plate .
this is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his / her own  |||  life  |||  .
the spots will " haunt " the viewers  |||  until  |||  2010 .
the ministry found inspiration in  |||  similar  |||  campaigns in anglo - saxon countries , where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims .
sugar and whip for  |||  drivers  |||
" the  |||  drivers  |||  are influenced by the sugar and whip system .
the sugar for them is , for example , when they run a red light , they  |||  save  |||  time .
the whip is the threat of a  |||  fine  |||  or an accident .
the drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the  |||  risk  |||  , " says martin kořán , a transportation psychologist from na homolce hospital .
and that 's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are  |||  necessary  |||  , the psychologist believes .
less  |||  effective  |||  in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers ' attention to the danger .
" if a static table which warns against danger is  |||  installed  |||  , it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it , " kořán warned .
olmert would  |||  return  |||  nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace
the prime minister of the provisional israeli government , ehud olmert ,  |||  expressed  |||  his opinion in favour of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967 , that is , even transjordan , east jerusalem and the golan heights , in exchange for peace with the palestinians and with syria .
he did this in an  |||  interview  |||  which was printed by the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth on monday .
" we must reach an agreement with the palestinians , which means that it will be  |||  necessary  |||  to return nearly all of the ( occupied ) territories , if not all of them , " olmert told the newspaper .
" we will keep a  |||  certain  |||  percentage of these territories , but we will have to cede a similar percentage ( of israeli territory ) to the palestinians , because there will be no peace if we do n't do that , " he added .
he admitted that the possible restitution would also  |||  include  |||  east jerusalem .
" whoever wants to be safe in jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs , like what happened to one of my best friends , will have to give up a part of jerusalem , " olmert  |||  noted  |||  in reference to two attacks in the city in july , during which several people were killed and tens injured .
according to the  |||  prime minister  |||  , it will be necessary to find a " special solution for the temple mount , a sacred and historic place " , which lies inside the old city .
" whoever will want to  |||  maintain  |||  israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 arabs .
that wo n't work , " he  |||  stressed  |||  further .
olmert also  |||  expressed  |||  his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of israel from the golan heights , which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with syria .
but that would also require  |||  certain  |||  effort from damascus .
" the syrians know well what they will have to give up in  |||  order  |||  to gain the golan heights .
they will have to give up their current relationship with iran ; they will have to give up their relationship to the ( shi - ite movement ) hezbollah ; they will have to give up the ongoing support they  |||  provide  |||  to the terrorism of the ( shi - ite movement ) hamas , ( the terrorist network ) al-qaeda and the jihad ( holy war ) in iraq , " the prime minister specified .
questions after accident : are stewards in the bus  |||  illegal  |||  ?
in connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company student agency  |||  near  |||  padua , italy , the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion .
" if we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law , the activities of the steward are in conflict with the traffic law , " says speaker for the ministry of  |||  transportation  |||  karel hanzelka .
the accident , during which a twenty - two - year - old stewardess died  |||  last  |||  week , was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus .
unluckily , at that  |||  moment  |||  , the girl was sitting next to the driver , in the least safe place in the vehicle , even though there are two more seats reserved for her .
if this is not approved in the bus , the  |||  passengers  |||  must sit .
" we tried to find a solution to this with the ministry , and  |||  initially  |||  they did not permit the movement of the passengers .
eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat , " he conveyed his  |||  position  |||  .
however , nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from  |||  providing  |||  services .
the traffic law only knows the  |||  term  |||  vehicle conductor ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person , " speaker hanzelka added less unambiguously .
the head of the department of motor vehicle operation of the ministry of transportation , josef pokorný , on the contrary , said that the law treats this  |||  issue  |||  sufficiently .
" it depends on whether the bus has standing room  |||  permitted  |||  in its certification .
buses are divided into the categories of city bus , where there is standing room and  |||  limited  |||  maximum speed , inter - city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted , and coach buses , with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts .
like in an airplane , says  |||  expert  |||
jaroslav hořín , an expert on traffic safety for the national strategy for traffic safety ( besip ) , does not see any  |||  essential  |||  problem in the movement of stewards on the buses .
even there it is not  |||  certain  |||  when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head . "
" however , if the bus were to brake sharply , of course , the laws of physics are  |||  valid  |||  .
the transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations , " he says , and he also thinks that from the legal perspective , this  |||  issue  |||  is unresolved .
jančura willing to discontinue  |||  services  |||
student agency is the only bus transport provider to  |||  offer  |||  the steward service .
" but as soon as i gain the impression that the stewards ' job is  |||  risky  |||  , i will discontinue them .
passengers can get  |||  coffee  |||  and newspapers when boarding .
it would also  |||  save  |||  costs , " he says .
alexej litvin , head of asiana , which operates a fraction of the bus  |||  lines  |||  that sa does , explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests .
a young stewardess from the pilsen area , who had  |||  worked  |||  for the company for two years , died in an accident on the bus line to naples .
the bus driver tried to  |||  avoid  |||  it using a sharp manoeuvre , however , the front right part of the bus grazed it .
jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards '  |||  rest  |||  had been sold out .
" it is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses , they are  |||  blocked  |||  . "
the company plans to sue the  |||  driver  |||  of the truck .
the agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl 's family , but it expects financial  |||  compensation  |||  from the guilty party .
an adaptation of the law , on which a thirty - member expert group from the ministry of transportation has been  |||  working  |||  for over a year , could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses .
" but no concrete  |||  conclusion  |||  has been reached .
they are not dealing with buses much , it is more the point system , the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving , " says  |||  expert  |||  hořín .
duesseldorf  |||  hopes  |||  rest in frankfurt
in a letter from the westlb board of directors to the  |||  bank  |||  's employees , grand talk is not in short supply .
combining units of the duesseldorf institution with frankfurt 's deka bank , the notice made public on monday claims , could '  |||  create  |||  a major capital - market institution of the sparkassen finanzgruppe . '
generally , the letter suggests , this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for  |||  further  |||  concentration in the area of the german state banks , the landesbanken .
that 's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to  |||  demonstrate  |||  being on top of things in difficult times .
but talks of some type of jointer between deka bank , which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment  |||  funds  |||  , and westlb have been making the rounds for some time now - even in frankfurt .
but the administrative board of deka , which is owned in equal parts by the landesbanken and the savings banks associations , has asked the board of directors to commence talks with westlb on joint  |||  business  |||  ventures .
the possible subject is the capital - market business , or  |||  parts  |||  of it .
of course , as sources in the financial community point out , negotiations have only just  |||  begun  |||  .
in 2003 , a merger of deka bank with landesbank rhineland - palatinate and helaba briefly  |||  seemed  |||  to be within the realm of possibility .
as soon as the plans became  |||  public  |||  , the hessian state government spoke out against the participation of helaba .
|||  instead  |||  , landesbank rhineland - palatinate was bought by stuttgart 's landesbank baden - wuerttemberg .
this aside , there  |||  seems  |||  to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative .
first up , now that the state elections in bavaria are over , a jointer between bayernlb and the landesbank baden - wuerttemberg may have  |||  become  |||  more likely .
for helaba , that 's not necessarily good  |||  news  |||  .
should the pressure for more mergers  |||  increase  |||  , it will by degrees be running out of potential partners .
in the south , it would merely be a junior partner , although it has to  |||  date  |||  weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in munich and stuttgart .
a merger with westlb , in turn , was squashed  |||  early  |||  this year by the savings bank association of hesse and thuringia , which owns 85 percent of helaba .
but such  |||  geostrategic  |||  considerations are only one side of the equation .
on the other stands the question in how far the institutions ' different  |||  business  |||  models are compatible with another .
in june , merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate  |||  business  |||  model to ensure the sustainability of the landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the german savings bank association .
ultimately , westlb might also be split up , although , of  |||  course  |||  , that 's not a solution favored at westlb .
the letter from its board of directors , accordingly , voices the manifest desire for a '  |||  comprehensive  |||  solution . '
quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between  |||  individual  |||  units of westlb and deka bank remains to be seen .
second weekend at the ' wiesn ' is  |||  known  |||  as ' italian weekend '
behind them , next to a five - litre keg of kaiser beer , stands a massively built bearded man who is proving to the approximately 200 oktoberfest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his throat his  |||  capable  |||  of producing .
from here , a parking lot for buses next to the railroad station puorta nuova ,  |||  four  |||  buses will depart at 11:45 tonight , ' destinazione monaco , festa della birra . ' estimated time of arrival : 6:30 am.
three buses are reserved for  |||  italians  |||  mainly , one is exclusively for brazilians .
and very loudly , too ,  |||  says  |||  marco guarda - too loudly for italians .
marco , who wears a  |||  long  |||  coat with fake fur lining and glasses with broad silver earpieces , owns the buses .
they have been making trips to the oktoberfest for five years now , three of them this year  |||  alone  |||  .
staying over night would only generate  |||  unnecessary  |||  costs , marco says .
the trip is 75 euros , including a welcoming round of kaiser beer , brewed according to the bavarian purity law , health insurance , as well as a  |||  german  |||  - language guide - marco enrolled in a language course in frankfurt .
and with no further ado , the buses head out into the  |||  night  |||  , on the autostrada leading to ' brennero . '
there is no  |||  beer  |||  to be had yet .
|||  soon  |||  all is quiet in the bus , the travelers are asleep .
when marco 's group finally arrives , as  |||  planned  |||  , at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near theresienwiese , about 50 other buses from all over europe are already there .
elena , luca and the  |||  others  |||  gather . marco addresses them one last time to give them their marching orders .
first up : put on the  |||  yellow  |||  caps .
on the  |||  left  |||  side , they say ' oktoberfest ' in gothic type , next to the internet address of marco 's travel agency , " conoscersiviaggiando . it " .
second : ' when the doors of the beer tent  |||  open  |||  , you have to run ! ' marco shouts into the morning .
' not in the front , or else we will block the entry . and not all  |||  yellow  |||  hats at the same tables - spread out in the room ! '
it 's 8.25  |||  euros  |||  per ' maß , ' marco screams .
'  |||  show  |||  the security people that we behave !
they want to be  |||  prepared  |||  for the retreat .
there are no exact figures ; estimates say that around 50,000 make their way  |||  across  |||  the alps to descent on the beer tents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are said to have arrived from italy specifically for this purpose .
munich 's police are reinforced by seven policemen from south tyrol , and italian volunteers are lending support to the bavarian red cross , according to whose statistics on nationals the italians are  |||  leading  |||  the medical - attention field with about 200 cases , with austrians ( about 80 cases ) and britons ( about 60 cases ) coming in second and third .
italians are  |||  especially  |||  fond of the ' hofbräu ' tent .
no sleep for hypo  |||  real  |||  estate creditors
as recently as  |||  last  |||  week , german finance minister peer steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of germany was relatively stable .
it 's a good thing that the politician used the term ' relatively , ' further interjecting that the  |||  german  |||  banking sector would n't be spared by the crisis .
the real - estate bank hypo  |||  real  |||  estate ( hre ) from munich , which is listed in the dax stock index , is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of german banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences .
an individual close to the proceedings  |||  told  |||  reuters on monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion euros total .
hypo  |||  real  |||  estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using , they said .
the money was  |||  coming  |||  from private as well as public banks , they added .
in the first half - year of 2008 , the bank 's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 euros , with the  |||  capital  |||  resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent .
the ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year , while earnings from write - ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from  |||  credit  |||  transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros .
the decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former depfa group , as well as from refunds of interest according to the fiscal  |||  code  |||  and from agency for group companies .
because earnings in classical government - funding were slim , depfa had diversified internationally , increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of  |||  joint  |||  ventures between private investors and the government ( public - private partnership , ppp ) .
now hypo real estate has to induce write - offs according to the subsidiary 's worth that will have a '  |||  significant  |||  , material effect ' on the group 's profit - and - loss statement , it said rather vaguely .
since the acquisition of depfa , hypo  |||  real  |||  estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure .
because it does not have client deposits , it is more  |||  dependent  |||  on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks .
with the collapse two weeks ago of  |||  american  |||  investment bank lehman brothers , the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again , because banks are hoarding their assets .
for part of depfa 's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros - hypo  |||  real  |||  estate annually requires short - term capital for refinancing .
according to hypo  |||  real  |||  estate , the credits meet the group 's financing requirements for the foreseeable future , shielding the corporation from ' the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets . '
hre chairman of the board georg funke said that , in the foreseeable future , the hypo  |||  real  |||  estate group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again , however .
the deutsche bundesbank and the federal institute for financial services supervision ( bafin ) are now considering the hypo  |||  real  |||  estate group 's marketability to be secured .
after the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late sunday night , even a bailout , temporary as it is , is  |||  incapable  |||  of easing people 's minds .
the price per  |||  share  |||  is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 euros .
to date , hypo  |||  real  |||  estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment . after the financial crisis , as well as the bank 's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of depfa , however , their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system .
as long as central banks , governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to  |||  support  |||  the system , bond settlement deadlines can be met .
alternatively , that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass , and the financial crisis will be overcome within the  |||  next  |||  15 months .
but  |||  considering  |||  that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next , a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope .
this may be causing some sleepless nights for long - term creditors in  |||  particular  |||  , as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure .
short - term investors may at least use the  |||  line  |||  that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry - forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come .
when sylvana hiltrop , 16 years old , is asked to introduce herself on her first day at tachibana high school , the girls  |||  begin  |||  to giggle : the german girl is totally ' kawaii ' !
what this  |||  means  |||  ?
' first day at school in  |||  japan  |||  .
the way to  |||  school  |||  alone gave me the jitters .
students begin trickling in at eight o'clock , until a brief conference with the teacher , the '  |||  home  |||  room , ' starts at 8:40 .
but before class  |||  began  |||  , it was my turn to introduce myself .
i 'm not someone who likes to  |||  talk  |||  in front of other people , mind you , let alone a class of 40 .
because i did n't have a  |||  school  |||  uniform yet , i was dressed in one of my host mother 's old skirts , as well as a blouse , blue stockings and black leather shoes .
in this attire , i stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly : ' sayonara wo she sylvana ... ' - my  |||  name  |||  is sylvana , i 'm from germany and my birthday is a week from now .
at that  |||  moment  |||  , i was very glad that i 'd been learning the language for two years already .
i already  |||  knew  |||  it from my manga .
it 's part of the  |||  essential  |||  vocabulary of japanese girls and means ' cute , ' ' sweet . '
then i scurried to my  |||  seat  |||  .
they were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another , even though japanese english is really hard to  |||  understand  |||  .
my host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me , too - it 's something else than the bleak  |||  german  |||  lunch break sandwiches .
i had rice with herbs ,  |||  little  |||  sausages , salad made from cucumber and algae , fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat .
at japanese schools , the bentos are n't just  |||  lunch  |||  .
sometimes it  |||  happens  |||  that a girl gives a homemade bento that she 's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy , in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break .
i  |||  read  |||  about that in my manga .
i 'm looking forward to finding out  |||  whether  |||  that 's happening here , too .
and i always  |||  told  |||  them :
and in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them , i eventually started to learn a  |||  little  |||  japanese , as well .
because i also have a penchant for  |||  tradition  |||  , manners and customs .
on the one hand , japan is the  |||  land  |||  of the latest technologies and trends , but on the other hand it is strict , disciplined and traditional .
and because everything is so well - organized , i have n't felt  |||  lost  |||  yet , even though tokyo is the biggest city i 've ever seen .
when in danger , a rat or roach will run away . does it mean they experience  |||  fear  |||  , too ?
neuroscientist joseph ledoux is  |||  convinced  |||  that many animals have feelings , as well .
the internet magazine ' edge ' has been running pieces by  |||  famous  |||  scientists for years .
in a series , spiegel online presents a selection of responses to the question , ' what do you  |||  consider  |||  to be true without being able to prove it ? '
i believe that animals have feelings , as well as other modes of awareness , although neither i nor anybody else have been able to prove it to  |||  date  |||  . for that matter , we have n't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness .
but in that case , we can at least  |||  hope  |||  , since all human brains possess the same basic configuration .
as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in  |||  general  |||  , however , we are entering difficult terrain , because the hardware is not compatible .
|||  humans  |||  behave similarly , which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable .
there are two aspects of our brain  |||  structure  |||  that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals .
so at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the  |||  knowledge  |||  who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates .
another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man 's linguistic  |||  nature  |||  : because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language , it 's often said that their awareness depends on it .
in that case , animals could be  |||  excluded  |||  .
but even if awareness was not dependent on  |||  language  |||  , it would certainly be affected by it , meaning that animal awareness , however it may be defined , would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness .
that 's why it is so  |||  difficult  |||  to determine what animal awareness may be like .
if you have something that , being internal and subjective , can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience , then its study comes with  |||  significant  |||  challenges .
my explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness , but aside from that , there is  |||  another  |||  important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically .
animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content , and that 's exactly what 's  |||  happening  |||  in the study of the short - term memory of primates , particularly when it comes to the example of visualization .
interestingly , this  |||  approach  |||  also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization .
what does this mean for  |||  feelings  |||  , now ?
let me remind you that an emotional system like that of  |||  fear  |||  is triggered in a brain that 's aware of its own activity .
what we  |||  call  |||  ' fear , ' consequently , is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain ( or its effects , such as physical reactions ) is using virtual memory .
in contrast to this , antonio damasio supposes , for instance , that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations . jaak pankseep says something similar , but his  |||  focus  |||  is more on the brainstem .
|||  since  |||  this network had n't changed in the course of human evolution , they say , it might well be a cause of cross - species sensations .
pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it , as well , in both cases . but how can we determine whether rats and humans  |||  feel  |||  the same thing when they act in similar ways ?
a roach 's response to danger is flight . does it experience  |||  fear  |||  ?
as far as i 'm concerned , a mere similarity of  |||  actions  |||  is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences .
the neural comparison is helpful , granted : rats and humans have  |||  similar  |||  brainstems , whereas roaches do not even have brains .
but is the brainstem  |||  responsible  |||  for emotions ?
but i would n't know how to  |||  prove  |||  it .
just like i do n't study  |||  language  |||  and awareness in rats , neither do i study their emotions , given that i do n't even know if they exist .
uefa president platini : reprieve for poland and  |||  ukraine  |||
ukrainian vice prime minister ivan vasyunik said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the president and the  |||  prime minister  |||  .
' the government considers uefa 's decision a display of  |||  trust  |||  in ukraine and its ability to host the eurocup together with poland , ' vasyunik said .
' this is no amnesty for our  |||  country  |||  .
work has only just begun , and there is much still to be done in both  |||  countries  |||  . '
' we cannot  |||  waste  |||  any more time .
we have to proceed at great speed now , ' said grigoriy surkis , president of the  |||  ukrainian  |||  soccer association .
an even more radical measure was taken in  |||  poland  |||  .
after  |||  numerous  |||  scandals , the leadership of the polish association pzpn was suspended by the national olympic committee and replaced with independent administrator robert zawlocki .
there was ' the  |||  serious  |||  danger that the pzpn is not able to act according to the rules , ' drzeviecki told polish news agency pap .
' we have reassured uefa president michel platini in a letter that  |||  preparations  |||  for the euro 2012 will not suffer because of this . '
indignant dennis quaid strikes  |||  back  |||
she wanted to promote a new film , talked about personal  |||  matters  |||  in an interview - and now she 's in trouble with her ex : hollywood star meg ryan called her former husband dennis quaid an adulterer .
the latter is fuming at her - and strikes  |||  back  |||  .
belated marital war between  |||  former  |||  spouses meg ryan and dennis quaid : seven years after divorcing , the two hollywood actors are now engaged in an unsightly - and public - argument .
in an interview with u.s. magazine ' instyle ' last week , meg ryan had for the first time addressed the reasons for the failure of the marriage : ' dennis was cheating on me for a  |||  long  |||  time , and that was very painful . '
dennis quaid 's reaction to being portrayed as a cheating husband was unequivocal : it was ' outrageous , ' the 54 - year - old  |||  told  |||  the ' new york daily news , ' that ' meg is repeatedly rehashing and revising the history of our relationship . '
it was also ' regrettable ' that their  |||  common  |||  16 - year - old son jack was again ' publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals a divorce brings for any child , ' he said .
while ryan has been  |||  living  |||  on her own since the divorce , quaid remarried and recently became the father of twins .
he concluded his comments with a sideswipe . ' my  |||  life  |||  has moved on , at any rate .
in the first half - year of 2008 , flights and rooms in europe were cheaper than in the  |||  previous  |||  year .
in germany , flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent , a  |||  current  |||  survey says .
rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again , according to a survey by travel and financial services provider  |||  american  |||  express .
analyzing its booking data from the first half - year of 2008 , the company found that , after an increase of rates in the first quarter , there was a significant drop in the  |||  second  |||  quarter .
from january to march , rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed european cities were still increasing by an  |||  average  |||  6.9 percent compared to 2007 .
but from april to june , rates had already dropped by 3.6 percent versus the  |||  previous  |||  year .
the trend was most visible in paris and  |||  rome  |||  , the survey says , where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago .
|||  american  |||  express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this , as it results in a ' decreasing desire for travel among american tourists . '
financial  |||  centers  |||  like frankfurt and london were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as hannover , cologne or stavanger , it further says .
due to the increasing cost of kerosene , economy - class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on  |||  average  |||  than in 2007 , while rates for more fuel - intensive long - range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent .
from april to june , economy - class flight rates dropped by an average 12.5 percent versus the preceding quarter , whereas  |||  business  |||  - and first - class price changes were much less noticeable .
in germany ,  |||  rates  |||  dropped even more sharply than in other european countries .
the rates of domestic  |||  german  |||  flights were halved even , a survey says .
on the one hand , the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing  |||  economic  |||  growth , the company says .
|||  demand  |||  was receding in many segments of the air - travel market , it says .
among the signs of increasing tension were the cancelation of unprofitable routes at airlines , it says , as well as the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half - year of 2008 - in europe  |||  alone  |||  , it was 24 airlines , it says .
at borussia , luhukay remains unable to find a  |||  working  |||  team .
he simply knew that he was  |||  right  |||  .
' we need the second goal , ' hermann rieger hissed in the hallway at hamburg  |||  arena  |||  .
rieger was hsv 's physiotherapist for nearly three  |||  decades  |||  . he is held in higher esteem than some other lapsed actors .
and thus , his plea was  |||  heard  |||  by the powers that be .
cornelius is the  |||  brother  |||  of hamburg 's coach - in - chief , martin jol .
' not everything was fun to look at today , ' marcell jansen later  |||  admitted  |||  .
hamburg has to thank mladen petric for scoring the 1-0 ( 1-0 ) with his header ( 11th ) ; and the fact that a very weak gladbach team proved  |||  unable  |||  to hit the weak hamburg team where it hurts .
' it was a  |||  dirty  |||  victory , ' martin jol summed things up .
spectators began celebrating on saturday evening -  |||  themselves  |||  , the blue sky above the arena and the instant chart on the video screen that showed their club as top of the class .
it 's going to be a birthday without a real  |||  party  |||  .
he senses that the chart 's intermediate report says more about the unpredictability of the liga than about the  |||  dominance  |||  of his hsv .
the  |||  team  |||  and its belatedly signed - on new members - brazilians neves and silva , goal - getter petric , as well as jansen , who was wooed away from fc bayern - are slowly finding their form , but they are not shining brightly yet .

large - scale investor warren buffet had bought into the  |||  company  |||  only a few days ago .
the bailout included the provision of  |||  funds  |||  for the acquisition of so - called bad mortgage certificates .
in turn , the united states was to obtain stock purchase warrants from the finance companies that could be discharged once share prices were appropriate , in order to  |||  reduce  |||  the burden on the national treasury .

for years , a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped : dark matter is  |||  affecting  |||  the speed of space probes during so - called swing - by maneuvers .
experts fear that albert einstein 's  |||  general  |||  theory of relativity may not be entirely correct .
for almost 18 years , the probe ' ulysses ' has been flying through  |||  space  |||  .
among scientists , a mysterious phenomenon has been  |||  causing  |||  confusion for years - the swing - by anomaly .
it  |||  enables  |||  the probes to save a lot of fuel .
the european -  |||  american  |||  research probe cassini - huygens made use of this physical trick , as did the solar probe ulysses .
rather , there are irregularities in their  |||  speed  |||  .
to date , physicists have been  |||  unable  |||  to explain this effect .
some experts fear that even albert einstein 's  |||  general  |||  theory of relativity , which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space , may not be entirely correct .
the  |||  american  |||  physicist stephen adler at the institute for advanced study in princeton still firmly believes that einstein did not err , and is trying to explain the swing - by anomaly by way of the so - called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe .
' it could be dark matter existing very  |||  close  |||  to earth that may be responsible for the anomaly , ' he writes .
space researchers have only been  |||  aware  |||  of the existence of dark matter for about ten years .
evidently , it emits a gravitational force whose  |||  effect  |||  on other celestial bodies is measurable .
according to the scientists ' calculations , dark  |||  matter  |||  constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe .
abducted tourists in  |||  egypt  |||  released
after being held hostage by their captors for ten days , the tourists abducted in egypt have evidently been released , as confirmed by the  |||  italian  |||  foreign minister .
the abductors from sudan had  |||  demanded  |||  a ransom of several million euros .
in the south of  |||  egypt  |||  , five germans have been abducted .
|||  negotiations  |||  concerning a ransom are reportedly already underway .
time and  |||  again  |||  , germans end up in the crosshairs of kidnappers .
' welt  |||  online  |||  ' reports the most notable cases .
the european tourists abducted in the sahara have  |||  apparently  |||  been freed .
reports by egyptian state television , the arabian tv channel al-arabiya and italian  |||  media  |||  are in accordance on that .
according to  |||  italian  |||  tv channel sky tg 24 , italian foreign minister franco frattini confirmed the release : ' our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed .
right now we are checking their  |||  health  |||  , ' frattini said .
the 19 participants of a  |||  desert  |||  expedition were already on their way to cairo , it said .
the circumstances of the shoot - out preceding the release remain unclear : according to an egyptian security agent , the captors were ready to end the abduction when the sudanese army suddenly  |||  killed  |||  six of the abductors .
' the problem had been  |||  solved  |||  .
it had been ' only a matter of receiving the hostages , ' when suddenly ' this  |||  surprise  |||  ' happened .
on sunday , sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the  |||  border  |||  region between sudan , chad and egypt .
the abductors had demanded a ransom of six million euros from germany ; the money was to be delivered by the  |||  german  |||  wife of one of the hostages .
citing a german negotiator , the daily newspaper ' el masri el jom '  |||  reported  |||  that the release was being delayed because the kidnappers were fearing for their safety .
the men were to be  |||  held  |||  captive until the abductors would have secured an escape route .
the  |||  german  |||  embassy in cairo declined to comment on the report .
stepfather abuse " led to  |||  suicide  |||  "
michael trerise , 57 , of stithians , cornwall , was jailed for six  |||  years  |||  after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault .
truro crown court  |||  heard  |||  he regularly tied up his step - daughter stephanie randle , when she was aged between five and seven .
trerise wrote in a confession note : " i feel  |||  responsible  |||  for her death . "
the court heard that ms randle killed herself at her  |||  home  |||  in mutley , plymouth , on 1 april 2007 , aged 34 .
his step -  |||  daughter  |||  went to plymouth .
by 2006 , prosecutor ramsey quaife told the  |||  court  |||  , friends said ms randle , who had been a keen surfer and cyclist , was " emotionally dead " , and had " given up on life " .
in april 2007 her  |||  real  |||  father , terrance randle , found her dead at her flat in plymouth .
i feel responsible for her  |||  death  |||  . "
judge christopher elwen  |||  told  |||  trerise : " you are an extremely strange fetishist , and for your victim it must have been terrifying , especially when she was only seven .
even more stark , is the fact that had she not done so , it 's very doubtful that  |||  matters  |||  would have ended up in court . "
" she was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising , successful and  |||  happy  |||  young woman . "
|||  lost  |||  data official to be charged
the cabinet office official who  |||  left  |||  top - secret documents on a train in june is to be charged under the official secrets act , the bbc has learned .
the man was on secondment from the ministry of defence when he  |||  left  |||  two highly classified documents on a train to waterloo .
the documents were passed to the bbc before being handed over to the  |||  police  |||  .
it is the least sensitive charge under the act and there is no suggestion of  |||  criminal  |||  intent .
bbc defence correspondent frank gardner said the  |||  move  |||  would have come as a surprise to many in whitehall .
" they will have  |||  thought  |||  this was being dealt with internally at the mod and cabinet office , " he said .
the employee , who cannot be named , is being charged under section 8.1 of the act , the  |||  clause  |||  which deals with safeguarding information .
the crown prosecution service recommended the official should be charged by the metropolitan police due to the highly sensitive  |||  nature  |||  of his work on the joint intelligence committee .
he was informed of the decision on monday morning and was moved from his  |||  home  |||  to an undisclosed location .
building societies  |||  face  |||  b&b bill
the government  |||  provided  |||  gbp 14bn to protect the deposits of bradford & bingley 's 2.6 million savers .
the  |||  interest  |||  on that loan will be paid by all firms that take savers ' money , including the 59 building societies .
the director  |||  general  |||  of the building societies association ( bsa ) adrian coles said it was " galling " that societies and their members had to pay .
the gbp 14bn loan will eventually be repaid as bradford & bingley 's  |||  mortgages  |||  are redeemed .
but the interest which will accrue in the meantime will be charged  |||  each  |||  year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits .
the financial services compensation scheme confirmed to the bbc that the 59 building societies would be included in that  |||  number  |||  .
it is galling that those  |||  institutions  |||  that behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent
the treasury estimates that the  |||  interest  |||  on the loan will amount to gbp 450m in 2009 .
that means the societies will have to find gbp 81m to pay the first year 's  |||  interest  |||  .
adrian coles , director  |||  general  |||  of the building societies ' trade association , told the bbc he believes that is unfair .
" it is galling that those  |||  institutions  |||  that behaved prudently in the housing market upswing are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent . "
according to the bsa , no society has failed  |||  since  |||  its records began in 1945 .
" we will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a  |||  significant  |||  bill , " added mr cole .
in 2010 a  |||  full  |||  year 's interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much .
since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders , their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower  |||  interest  |||  rates on saving accounts .
|||  milk  |||  to go up five pence a litre
people in jersey are facing having to pay more for their  |||  milk  |||  .
jersey dairy has announced that it will  |||  increase  |||  the wholesale price of its milk by an extra five pence a litre from monday .
retailers are to  |||  decide  |||  for themselves if they want pass on the price increases to their customers .
before the february  |||  increase  |||  , the wholesale price of jersey milk last changed in 2002 .
a bangladesh court has rejected a bail plea of  |||  former  |||  pm sheikh hasina , meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country .
her lawyers said the  |||  court  |||  refused to grant her bail over charges of extorting 50 million taka ( $ 729,700 ) from a businessman when she was pm .
the case is one of several corruption  |||  charges  |||  pending against her .
sheikh hasina 's long - time political rival , khaleda zia , was released on bail  |||  earlier  |||  this month .
sheikh hasina is due to return to bangladesh over the next few weeks but her party , the awami league , has demanded that the country 's military - backed caretaker government should first give her  |||  full  |||  freedom .
correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment , it is not clear under the  |||  terms  |||  of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to bangladesh .
" the high court rejected sheikh hasina 's bail petition  |||  saying  |||  that she does n't have to get bail as she 's already undergoing treatment abroad on parole , " her barrister rafique - ul huq said .
her lawyers argued that she  |||  needed  |||  bail to come back to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in december .
sheikh hasina is expected to return  |||  home  |||  after 17 october , a senior awami league party leader said on sunday .
she was detained last year after the army - backed interim government assumed power , but was  |||  released  |||  from prison in june , to go abroad for medical treatment .
the un carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces  |||  last  |||  week .
but it says it could not  |||  reach  |||  children in parts of helmand and kandahar in the south for security reasons .
a un spokesman said this was despite pledges from the taleban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of  |||  staff  |||  carrying out the vaccinations .
bskyb has lost its legal challenge to the competition commission 's decision forcing the  |||  firm  |||  to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster itv .
bskyb has been told by the competition  |||  appeal  |||  tribunal to cut its holding in itv from 17.9 % to below 7.5 % .
previously , the commission said that bskyb 's stake thwarted  |||  competition  |||  and allowed it unfair influence over itv .
in april 2007 , the office of fair trading  |||  reported  |||  that bskyb 's acquisition of its stake in itv shed doubt on the independence of itv , prompting the competition commission to launch a probe .
virgin boss sir richard branson , consumer groups and the regulator ofcom all opposed the  |||  purchase  |||  .
bskyb argued that forcing it to  |||  reduce  |||  its itv stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as bskyb had said it would surrender its voting rights .
the us attorney general has  |||  appointed  |||  a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine us attorneys in 2006 .
the  |||  move  |||  came as a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
special prosecutor nora dannehy will now investigate whether  |||  officials  |||  questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice .
" serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , " inspector  |||  general  |||  glenn fine said in his report .
the appointment of a special prosecutor with the  |||  power  |||  to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations .
the row began when nine us attorneys were removed from their  |||  positions  |||  by the us department of justice in december 2006 .
some of the attorneys had been  |||  involved  |||  in the prosecution of high - profile republican members of congress , while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against democrats .
the then head of the justice department , attorney general alberto gonzales , came under  |||  fire  |||  for the sackings , and eventually resigned his position .
a number of other  |||  justice  |||  department officials also resigned .
the inspector  |||  general  |||  's report was highly critical of mr gonzales 's role in the affair , saying he bore " primary responsibility " for the sackings , that he " abdicated " his leadership role and was " remarkably unengaged " in the process .
the singer , who will collect his special golden award at  |||  next  |||  week 's ceremony in london , said he was " honoured " to gain recognition .
coldplay are  |||  leading  |||  the nominations for this year 's awards , making the shortlists of four categories .
paul rees , q magazine 's editor - in -  |||  chief  |||  , said : " there are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre , and bat out of hell is assuredly one of them . "
it opened with an instrumental  |||  section  |||  which lasted almost two minutes .
the song was released as a  |||  single  |||  in the uk in 1979 and peaked at number 15 .
but meat loaf 's bat out of hell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies  |||  worldwide  |||  .
meat loaf -  |||  real  |||  name marvin lee aday - has suffered health problems in recent years , including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage .
in 2007 , acute laryngitis forced him to cancel  |||  concerts  |||  .
new york city has thousands of avenues , boulevards , streets and other byways , some  |||  famous  |||  , others merely utilitarian .
the tiny street is in the east village and runs north from first street - without making it to  |||  second  |||  street - between the bowery and second avenue .
for instance , there is avalon bay , the developer of recently constructed  |||  luxury  |||  buildings on first street .
it wants to repave extra place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to  |||  open  |||  in the new buildings .
other admirers  |||  include  |||  longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block 's pregentrified past .
but the city 's department of housing preservation and development , which has control of the street , has no interest in  |||  holding  |||  on to it .
at a  |||  meeting  |||  of the neighborhood community board 's land use committee this month , representatives of the city agency and avalon bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street .
but the committee prefers that the street  |||  remain  |||  in the city 's hands , and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month , said susan stetzer , the district manager of community board 3 .
" there 's very  |||  little  |||  city - owned space left , and we would like the city to continue to own extra place , " she said .
" there could be proposals to fix it up and manage it , which could be done by avalon , but we also want to  |||  guarantee  |||  public access . "
avalon bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the  |||  little  |||  street and install seats , including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space .
the idea that avalon bay  |||  might  |||  buy the street was first made public at this month 's meeting .
michele de milly , a spokeswoman for avalon bay , said that  |||  though  |||  the company wanted to use the street , it did not necessarily want to own it .
" avalon bay 's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a  |||  public  |||  amenity , " she said , adding that the city had suggested the sale .
some  |||  believe  |||  it got its name in 1802 , when a large farm owned by philip minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed .
some residents , including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the east village , have opposed the idea of selling extra place , arguing that the piece of public property , modest as it is , should  |||  remain  |||  public .
others have lauded extra place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that  |||  ought  |||  to be left alone .
jeremiah moss , who runs a blog called jeremiah 's vanishing new york ( subtitled , " the book of lamentations : a bitterly nostalgic  |||  look  |||  at a city in the process of going extinct " ) , posted part of a talk of the town story about extra place that appeared in the new yorker in 1952 .
the author , brendan gill , wrote : " extra place is a  |||  narrow  |||  little dead - end street , dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows , with week - old newspapers blowing along the gutters . "
with a few exceptions , the street looked much the same on a  |||  recent  |||  evening .
a rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to  |||  lead  |||  into cbgb , which is now the site of an upscale clothing store .
graffiti was on walls and an empty 22 - ounce beer bottle lay near a  |||  fresh  |||  batch of discarded newspapers .
mr. fields , for his part , said he  |||  thought  |||  that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state .
" the best years of my life , " he said , " were in places that were  |||  dark  |||  , damp and disgusting . "
the bilingual  |||  debate  |||  : english immersion
in this installment of education watch , bruce fuller and lance t. izumi discuss the candidates '  |||  positions  |||  on bilingual education .
lance t. izumi , a senior fellow in california studies and the senior director of education studies at the pacific research institute for public policy , is the co - author of the book " not as good as you think : why the middle class needs school  |||  choice  |||  . "
making effective appeals to hispanic  |||  voters  |||  is a tricky business .
mr. obama 's campaign notes that , " african -  |||  american  |||  and latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students , " which is true .
to combat such achievement gaps , mr. obama 's education plan specifically  |||  advocates  |||  , among other things , " transitional bilingual education " for english - learners .
yet , the question for mr. obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education , which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than  |||  english  |||  , overrides his interest in closing achievement gaps .
take , for example , sixth street prep , a charter elementary  |||  school  |||  in eastern los angeles county .
a nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth graders tested proficient on the state english -  |||  language  |||  - arts exam .
sixth street emphasizes review and practice ,  |||  constant  |||  assessment of skills and a no - excuses attitude .
furthermore , and here 's where mr. obama should take note , according to linda mikels , sixth street 's principal , the school 's instructional approach for english learners is "  |||  full  |||  immersion . "
english immersion emphasizes the  |||  near  |||  - exclusive use of english in content instruction .
ms. mikels , who opposes bilingual education ,  |||  told  |||  me , " we 've had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from mexico and you would walk into a classroom 12 months later and you would n't be able to pick out which one he was . "
" it 's  |||  working  |||  , " she observed , " it 's working for us . "
the school 's achievement results should make the answer to that question a no - brainer , but the education politics within his own party ( the national education associations has been a long - time supporter of bilingual education ) and his own  |||  consistent  |||  support for bilingual education obscure predicting mr. obama 's response .
while he agrees that immigrants should learn english , mr. obama recently trivialized the  |||  issue  |||  when he said that people should stop worrying about " english - only " legislation .
instead , he said , " you need to make  |||  sure  |||  your child can speak spanish . "
if mr. obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps , he should carefully  |||  consider  |||  education models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them .
oil falls sharply on  |||  renewed  |||  economic fears
oil prices dropped sharply on monday because of concerns that even the  |||  american  |||  bailout plan for the financial markets may fail to revive the economy .
crude oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $ 99.80 a barrel on the new york mercantile  |||  exchange  |||  in morning trading .
in the last two weeks , commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on wall street , and a pair of  |||  powerful  |||  hurricanes in the gulf of mexico .
the news was overshadowed by fresh  |||  concerns  |||  that the financial crisis was far from over .
in the  |||  latest  |||  episode of the unfolding meltdown , citigroup will buy the banking operations of the wachovia corporation , the government said monday .
meanwhile , the belgian ,  |||  dutch  |||  and luxembourg governments partially nationalized the european financial conglomerate fortis .
as the  |||  economic  |||  situation deteriorates , the demand for commodities , including oil , is expected to slow down .
" we believe commodities will be unable to  |||  escape  |||  the contagion .
from a commodity perspective our most pressing  |||  concern  |||  is to what extent the us virus spreads globally and specifically to china . "
the bank 's analysts pared down their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops because of slowing  |||  economic  |||  growth , reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009 .
second - quarter spree sets team  |||  record  |||
after spending more time in a jets uniform the last eight - plus seasons than anyone , defensive end shaun ellis  |||  thought  |||  he had seen it all .
then he watched the  |||  second  |||  quarter unfold sunday , when the jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout .
" never seen  |||  anything  |||  quite like that , " ellis said .
the second quarter  |||  began  |||  after the jets and the arizona cardinals had matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play .
then quarterback brett favre found laveranues coles for a 12 - yard touchdown strike , providing the  |||  perfect  |||  harbinger for an afternoon when their evolving connection took a giant leap forward .
" he 's a hell of a  |||  player  |||  .
while favre and coles played catch , the  |||  defense  |||  battered cardinals quarterback kurt warner .
cornerback darrelle revis intercepted an errant throw and  |||  returned  |||  it 32 yards for a touchdown .
safety eric smith tipped  |||  another  |||  pass and intercepted it .
linebacker david bowens  |||  forced  |||  a fumble by warner .
the cardinals had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left , and after the jets recovered the ball , jay feely kicked a 20 - yard field goal for a 34-0  |||  lead  |||  .
it was the most the jets had ever scored in a  |||  quarter  |||  .
asked to describe the craziness of it , jets coach eric mangini said , " the  |||  second  |||  quarter or the third quarter ? "
when he was told both - the jets  |||  allowed  |||  21 unanswered points in the third quarter - mangini said : " i can tell you i enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than i did the third quarter .
rested gebrselassie tops his world  |||  record  |||
haile gebrselassie of ethiopia again showed why many  |||  consider  |||  him the greatest distance runner ever , breaking his own world record in the marathon in berlin on sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2 - mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes .
with a victory on the accommodatingly flat course in 2:03:59 , gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26 , run  |||  last  |||  year in berlin .
at 35 , gebrselassie set the 26th world  |||  record  |||  of a career of such stunning breadth that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon .
|||  last  |||  month , gebrselassie skipped the olympic marathon in beijing , fearing - perhaps too alarmingly , in retrospect - that the air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma .
instead , he signed to run in  |||  berlin  |||  .
in near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the  |||  start  |||  , 55 degrees at the finish - gebrselassie won sunday while averaging a blistering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile .
as track runners like gebrselassie and paul tergat of kenya have turned to longer distances , the  |||  record  |||  for the marathon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade , since ronaldo da costa of brazil won in berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998 .
after sunday 's victory , gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of  |||  training  |||  .
" i 'm so happy , " gebrselassie  |||  told  |||  reporters .
" everything was  |||  perfect  |||  .
i started again a week ago , and had some doubts today , but in the end everything was  |||  fine  |||  . "
he has come under some criticism - especially in kenya , ethiopia 's east african rival - for overly orchestrating his races , generally avoiding many of the world 's top marathon stars , relying on pacemakers as if it were a track  |||  race  |||  , and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition .
but this criticism  |||  hardly  |||  diminishes the greatness of gebrselassie 's skill as a distance runner .
paced by four kenyans on sunday , gebrselassie  |||  reached  |||  the midway point in 1:02:04 .
two  |||  elite  |||  kenyan runners , james kwambai and charles kamathi , kept challenging gebrselassie after the pacemakers faded .
a  |||  little  |||  more than three miles from the finish , gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from kwambai , who finished second in 2:05:36 , improving his personal best by nearly five minutes .
kamathi took  |||  third  |||  in 2:07:48 .
in the women 's  |||  race  |||  , irina mikitenko , a native of kazakhstan who is now a german citizen , completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19 , the seventh - fastest time ever .
paula radcliffe of great britain  |||  holds  |||  the world record of 2:15:25 .
last  |||  spring  |||  , mikitenko , 36 , was a surprise winner of the london marathon in 2:24:14 .
she missed the beijing games with what was described as a  |||  back  |||  injury , but recovered to win in berlin , setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she has run .
askale tafa magarsa of ethiopia took second in 2:21.31 , while helena kiprop of kenya  |||  finished  |||  third in 2:25:01 .
hidden in the theme - park sprawl of greater orlando , a few miles from the shiny , the loud and the gargantuan , lies a  |||  quiet  |||  town where the pride and complications of the african - american experience come to life .
alice walker , toni morrison and ruby dee have come to the  |||  annual  |||  zora ! festival in eatonville to pay their respects to hurston , the most famous female writer of the harlem renaissance .
it is as independent , dignified and private as it was in the 1930s , when hurston wrote that rural blacks in florida often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man , who " knowing so  |||  little  |||  about us , he does n't know what he is missing . "
even now , in a year when a black presidential nominee , senator barack obama , has called for an open conversation about race , many here  |||  remain  |||  wary of the outsider 's gaze .
" it needs to be  |||  right  |||  . "
it is a literary hub but also an oak - shaded example of rural southern black culture - sometimes disdained , sometimes praised - that was born of  |||  american  |||  slavery .
not surprisingly , residents here are both  |||  proud  |||  and protective .
and the  |||  concern  |||  about eatonville 's image really began with zora , which is all anyone here calls hurston .
five paragraphs in the florida guidebook transformed the town , just off route 17 , a road that runs through the oft - forgotten center of florida into a stage of  |||  black  |||  history and human drama .
" off the road on the  |||  left  |||  , " she wrote , " is the brown - with - white - trim modern public school , with its well - kept yards and playgrounds , which howard miller always looks after , though he can scarcely read and write . "
she also  |||  mentioned  |||  the new husband of widow dash and wrote that lee glenn " sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms . "
in fact , it was not a portrait  |||  everyone  |||  appreciated .
" zora  |||  told  |||  it like it was , " said ella dinkins , 90 , one of the johnson girls hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off - color songs about their beauty .
hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned after her  |||  family  |||  moved to jacksonville , fla.
augustus franklin , 77 , recalled that when hurston sped into town , she usually  |||  arrived  |||  without notice in a thumping chevrolet , smoking and wearing pants in a town that even today prides itself on dignified dress .
most  |||  residents  |||  were fascinated , mr. franklin said , while many sneered .
" people were  |||  always  |||  glad to see zora , " mr. franklin said .
but , he added , rocking in his chair on a  |||  back  |||  patio overlooking lake sabelia , where hurston was most likely baptized , " she never did stay too long . "
when hurston died in 1960 , she was  |||  poor  |||  and her books had fallen out of print .
along with much of the world , eatonville seemed to have  |||  forgotten  |||  her .
though she was once a literary star , a contemporary of langston hughes and the only black woman at barnard college in the 1920s , she was buried in an unmarked grave in fort pierce , fla. , where she had been  |||  living  |||  .
in eatonville , there were no  |||  major  |||  memorial services , no grand public readings .
a turning point  |||  came  |||  in the 1980s .
orange county  |||  officials  |||  wanted to put a five - lane highway through town to replace kennedy boulevard , the community 's puttering two - lane main street .
orlando 's sprawl had already pushed interstate 4 through the western edge of  |||  town  |||  .
the proposal came as eatonville was still recovering from a  |||  difficult  |||  period in its history .
|||  forced  |||  integration , among other things , had ended the community 's relatively idyllic isolation .
in the 1950s , the fight over racial mixing  |||  brought  |||  hate to the community 's doorstep .
" during that time , a bunch of white boys , they would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting down on the  |||  side  |||  , " mr. franklin said .
in a 1955 letter to the orlando sentinel , hurston questioned the supreme court 's demand for  |||  forced  |||  integration , calling its decision in brown v. board of education " insulting rather than honoring my race . "
residents now say that the desegregation of schools , while positive in some respects , diluted eatonville 's cohesiveness and undermined the confidence of its  |||  youth  |||  .
"  |||  black  |||  children were accustomed to being hugged - i remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning , you hugged your teacher at night , " said n. y. nathiri , the daughter of ella dinkins and the executive director of preserve the eatonville community , a nonprofit group .
civil rights , however ,  |||  helped  |||  create space for many more zora neale hurstons - black writers , actors and artists who rose above prejudice , like she did , with buoyant self - assurance and lines like : " how can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company !
in 1975 , the writer alice walker trekked to hurston 's unmarked grave and  |||  began  |||  fighting to resurrect her reputation .
five years later , an acclaimed hurston biography by robert e. hemenway hit bookshelves , reintroducing her to the  |||  american  |||  canon .
the highway project  |||  arrived  |||  just as eatonville 's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight .
the community began planning in 1988 for a hurston festival to  |||  show  |||  what the county could ruin with its highway .
after  |||  several  |||  years , the county backed away from its road proposal .
" the five - laning of the highway resurrected , it put in what you 'd call warp speed ,  |||  real  |||  civic pride , " ms. nathiri said .
ms. boyd put it more simply : " zora  |||  saved  |||  eatonville . "
victory over the highway project has  |||  helped  |||  change the town 's self - image .
out - of - towners like rachelle munson , a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993 , started to  |||  appear  |||  in larger numbers , and residents started to revalue the past .
eatonville joined the  |||  national  |||  historic registry in 1998 .
a new one - story library ( named after hurston , of course )  |||  opened  |||  in 2006 on a repaved and beautified kennedy boulevard .
( it is 90 percent  |||  black  |||  today . )
outsiders who come looking for eatonville 's story , its meaning , are often still  |||  treated  |||  with caution .
advance permission is  |||  required  |||  for most interviews , and certain things - like the murals at eatonville 's oldest church , painted by a white man , showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed .
and even those who are younger , like alondra and alexia kenon , 11 - year - old twins from winter park , seem to have learned to  |||  describe  |||  eatonville correctly .
" most people , if they just drive through here , they 'll think , ' oh , this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones , ' " alondra kenon said after church on a  |||  recent  |||  sunday .
over here in new york we all  |||  speak  |||  fluent finance
on the face of it , nothing has  |||  changed  |||  .
they would never guess that in the glass - fronted , honeycomb offices  |||  above  |||  their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise new york are daily having the worst " bad day at the office " since the crash of 1929 .
latino men still shuffle between apartment buildings carrying , like  |||  human  |||  mules , 50 - odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders .
even  |||  though  |||  i had timed the chore to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local branch of jp morgan chase , a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting in line .
unlike me , however , they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted , from the likes of new jersey , pennsylvania and staten  |||  island  |||  .
they had taken out money from so - called thrifts ( a bit like a  |||  building  |||  society ) , credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks whose branches only operate within one state , and who say they treat customers like family .
in the  |||  past  |||  year , 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust .
the office and shop workers standing in front of me , scared of  |||  another  |||  collapse , were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven , the bank that is doing most of the bailing out on wall street .
|||  ordinary  |||  new yorkers in the last few weeks have become fluent in finance .
she told me , after my  |||  visit  |||  to the bank , that " i got all my savings in money market funds now .
|||  muslim  |||  graves desecrated as austria swings to the right
police are blaming far right extremists for desecrating a muslim cemetery in austria , the same weekend that the political parties of the far right made huge gains in the country 's  |||  general  |||  election .
over 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in traun , near linz , some time between friday night and this morning , in what police believe was an organised  |||  action  |||  .
the offenders sprayed jewish symbols such as the star of david over some of the graves , but detectives  |||  believe  |||  this may have been a bid to disguise the motives of extremists driven by a hatred of muslim immigrants .
it is not  |||  clear  |||  whether the incident was in any way related to the elections .
a spokesman for the local islamic community said they were " deeply shocked " at the news of the desecration , which  |||  comes  |||  as the muslim religious month of ramadan nears its end .
austria is meanwhile embarking on a round of soul - searching following its swing to the  |||  right  |||  in yesterday 's parliamentary elections .
heinz - christian strache , the head of the freedom party that won over 18 per cent of the vote , campaigned against headscarves and burkas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be  |||  related  |||  to islam .
at his final rally in vienna , he spoke of a " european brotherhood " to  |||  prevent  |||  the rise of islam .
both parties seek to ban the building of mosques and minarets , arguing that they were political symbols of an  |||  ongoing  |||  islamisation of austria and europe .
polls and analysis conducted immediately after the elections , which established the far right as the country 's strongest political bloc , indicate that the change was brought about by predominately young voters who are  |||  concerned  |||  about their future in the european union .
gary glitter , the glam rock star  |||  convicted  |||  of child sex abuse , has been banned by the courts from travelling to france and spain .
magistrates imposed the six month ban on glitter after he  |||  informed  |||  the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to travel to spain via france .
a  |||  court  |||  service spokesman said : " on thursday september 25 at ashford magistrates ' court , kent police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to france and spain until march 25 by mr paul gadd .
" paul gadd did not attend in  |||  person  |||  . "
glitter , 64 , had  |||  informed  |||  the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offenders register .
he must give the authorities notice if he wishes to  |||  travel  |||  abroad for more than three days .
he is also required to give police seven days notice of his  |||  planned  |||  departure date .
failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five  |||  year  |||  prison sentence .
kent police said they would not  |||  discuss  |||  individual cases or the possible whereabouts of glitter in the county .
a kent police spokeswoman said : " kent police will do everything  |||  necessary  |||  to protect children in this country , or abroad .
glitter returned to the uk  |||  last  |||  month after spending 27 months in a vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls , aged 10 and 11 .
the thai authorities would not allow him through passport  |||  control  |||  and he eventually flew to hong kong .
chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew  |||  back  |||  to bangkok where thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to britain .
he eventually arrived at heathrow 's terminal 3 on august 22 and stayed there while his solicitor david corker went to uxbridge magistrates court , west london , as scotland yard successfully applied for an  |||  order  |||  requiring him to register as a sex offender .
glitter had previously been jailed in the uk for  |||  four  |||  months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse .
a  |||  home  |||  office source said that jacqui smith , the home secretary was reassured and glad that glitter has been stopped from travelling to france and spain .
" i photograph the  |||  master  |||  away from the scene to extract his character " günther bauer , photographer
only the essence of the great masters of flamenco , stripped of the concentration which characterizes the  |||  interpretation  |||  , to face a relaxed man or woman .
on one hand , the  |||  artist  |||  .
on the other , the  |||  person  |||  .
the two sides are inseparable , except in private life . in those moments ,  |||  away  |||  from the public , the privacy of a gesture , the depth of a stolen glance or the expressiveness of the hands , are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage .
german günther bauer , in the work " flamenco - people " , alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers , dancers and guitarists on stage with these masters ' private and less  |||  known  |||  being .
this is the photograph 's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco , taken from  |||  different  |||  perspectives .
the people i portrayed on the street " are " artists able to convey passion , sadness and joy when on  |||  stage  |||  ... and finally , to capture their audience .
it is much more an inner personality and  |||  character  |||  .
i 'm very interested in  |||  creating  |||  an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera . "
bauer  |||  began  |||  his path to portray singers , guitarists and dancers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival " cante de las minas " . he likes to use a plate camera .
the application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the iconographic traditional principles ,  |||  giving  |||  the photos modernity , as bauer considers flamenco : " a music with very traditional roots which evolves and still surprises every day more . "
it is not the dancing , the singing or the playing  |||  itself  |||  , but the artist 's personality , his character , able to conquer the audience through his art .
the search for a meeting with the essentiality , with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling , are and have been  |||  constant  |||  elements in this work , now on display at the gallery el fotómata .
|||  famous  |||  flamenco artists such as diego el cigala , chan lobato , cristina hoyos , enrique morente , el lebrija , antonio canales and vicente amigo among others , are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists .
although in " flamenco - people " the concept is  |||  different  |||  , the photographer admits " i love to portray people , to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while , being this a long or short moment .

the collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco ,  |||  entitled  |||  " flamenco - people " is exhibited at the gallery el fotómata , via de la mata 20 , which is a parallel street to alameda de hercules . the exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of october .
the novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject . despite this , mario vargas llosa is struggling with the new project he is  |||  working  |||  at , a novel whose protagonist , roger casemant , is an irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in congo and crossed amazon .
the writer , always favoured for the nobel prize in literature , confessed yesterday during the hay festival in segovia , that the draft he is dealing with is a " chance " and that everything indicates that i should not  |||  write  |||  it down . "
the hispanic - american novelist , acknowledged that " there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people 's lives . i refuse to  |||  believe  |||  that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience , " said vargas llosa who , also supported that " the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist . " so he suggested the writers " not to give into frivolity " and to " take the responsibility " of their own vocation .
the bullfights which were to seal the days of the festival of pozoblanco were suspended yesterday  |||  morning  |||  after the bull fighters had assured that the square 's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations .
therefore , the  |||  company  |||  , together with fermin bohorquez , pablo hermoso de mendoza and leonardo hernandez , decided to suspend the bullfighting .
among all , the worst was el juli , who  |||  passed  |||  by the bull - ring of los llanos gaining no glory , no penalty .
with the  |||  second  |||  bull , after a tremendous muleta , he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public .

the officials chased the van until the vehicle  |||  stopped  |||  after a couple of miles on the edge of the road , and its two occupants flew into a wooded area .
the ertzaintza officials managed to arrest one of the fugitives and , after the inspection of the van -- an iveco  |||  daily  |||  , seized 2178 kilograms of hashish .
the ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspected person who  |||  managed  |||  to flee as mentioned above , and to determine the origin of seized drugs .

llamazares urges the andalusian federation of iu to assume its responsibilities in the silva  |||  case  |||
gaspar llamazares , the  |||  general  |||  coordinator of iu and member of the party izquierda unida , confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the councillor for youth and sport of the city of siviglia , francisco manuel silva , who resigned last week after the accusation of cronyism . the case will be up to the regional federation for training .
moreover , the leader stressed the need for " transparency " in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregularity silva had  |||  committed  |||  , " the ui always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency . "
similarly , he stressed that training goes under " very strict codes of ethics for all  |||  public  |||  functions . "
jose luis garci , inspired by the novel episodios nacionales of banito pérez galdós , recreates in sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the  |||  french  |||  . this is the most ambitious work of his filmography , with a nearly 15 million euro budget .
with this film , the director has tried to " explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis " that he always admired in the work of the  |||  famous  |||  novelist , he said today , during the film 's presentation , with quim gutierrez and paula echevarría heading a larger cast of interpreters .
sangre de mayo , a film longer than 2.30 hours , debuts this friday at the cinemas , to become a four hours tv miniseries on telemadrid in next  |||  future  |||  .
however , the director regrets not having  |||  received  |||  equal funds of alatriste or los fantasmas de goya - more than twice compared to sangre de mayo . so far , it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan , he himself had signed together with horacio valcarcel , his career - long collaborator .
the difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of volver a empezar : for example , the staging with the actors , with  |||  whom  |||  he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast , considering this " humiliating " and thinking that " the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on . "
a certain  |||  number  |||  of interpreters , some of which fall within the cast of sangre de mayo , repeat in front of his video - camera . it is the case of michael rell , carlos larranaga or fernando guillen cuervo .
four times in the oscar nominations - winning one - garci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent spain at hollywood this year , his sangre de mayo , siete mesas de billar francés , and the los  |||  selected  |||  ulitmo girasoles ciegos do represent the spanish cinema 's younger generation , " that should be known instead . "
a siviglian dancer pays tribute to  |||  another  |||  siviglian dancer .
carmen valencia tortola , father from catalonia ( florenç tórtola ferrer ) and mother from andalusia ( georgina valencia valenzuela ) , was born in the district of triana , and moved with her  |||  family  |||  to london when three .
the life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aesthetics of  |||  dance  |||  in europe between the two wars , had always fascinated isabel bayon .
" i 'd liked to work with pepa gamboa , and she  |||  proposed  |||  me to interpret this character . it seemed to me incredible . "
the staging includes two outstanding contributions : that of miguel poveda , who will sing again isabel in one of the shows , the same he did in " la puerta abierta " , and the master matilde coral , which exceptionally wanted to work together with a  |||  former  |||  student of hers .
i 'm very happy she  |||  accepted  |||  to play in my work and i feel very honoured for this . "
this work also tell something of this woman 's life because it was mainly held in distant places , particularly for her time , such as india ,  |||  united  |||  states or russia , as well as the whole europe , using her to reside in london .
" i wanted to  |||  remember  |||  her , because i think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period . nowadays nobody remembers of her and even considers her work as something of value " supports bayon .
the show will be on stage  |||  starting  |||  from today , 20. 30pm , at the theatre lope de vega .
so far , the " 3 years anniversary of zenobia and juan ramon " ends with the second edition of this work , with the international congress  |||  held  |||  in new york , the restoration of the house - museum of the nobel prized and the travelling exhibition " juan ramón jiménez : aquel chop de luz " , which was inaugurated last may and , after having touched the various provinces of andalusia , is expected to be brought to new york in conjunction with the international congress .
we like  |||  america  |||  a bit less without paul newman
" sometimes god creates  |||  perfect  |||  people .
|||  paul  |||  newman was one of those . "
the sentence is by sally field , who worked with him in " ausencia de malicia " and gives the feeling of american cinema 's impotence , and  |||  throughout  |||  america , facing the shock that newman has gone .
" sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word , and now i  |||  lost  |||  a great friend , " cried robert redford , " my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence . "
when  |||  times  |||  are so difficult , men so less virtuous and with very few beings admired by people , you have not to be luis cernuda to love paul newman .
for all people he embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and  |||  truth  |||  .
the wave of  |||  admiration  |||  went beyond hollywood , independently from nationality or passport .
another english man , sam mendes , a director who won the oscar , said that  |||  working  |||  with newman was nothing less than the highest peak of his career .
the bad boy arrived from australia , russell crowe , arrived to define paul newman as his  |||  biggest  |||  inspiration .
" he left an example of the highest level for all of us , " notes george clooney , perhaps one of the few who try to live today as paul newman did : maintaining in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious private life ,  |||  away  |||  from the cameras .
this is not always easy or possible in contemporary  |||  media  |||  jungle .
however , some people will try and  |||  paul  |||  newman will remain a very good example to get them inspired .
after the divorce , his second marriage with joanne woodward lasted fifty years long , and he remained faithful having  |||  certainly  |||  opportunities for not being so .
in the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his daughters who are also his fans on the earth , something not so common in  |||  america  |||  .
" of all the  |||  major  |||  roles he interpreted , none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband , loving father , attentive grandfather and passionate philanthropist " they say .
the imperfect race of an olympic  |||  madrid  |||
yes , the dream of many of us is that one day olympics will be  |||  held  |||  in madrid and , after the failed attempt in 2012 , this could happen in 2016 .
but i wonder , are we  |||  ready  |||  ?
if we  |||  follow  |||  the example of yesterday race , i just say no !
they called it the "  |||  perfect  |||  race " but in my opinion it was by far the worst i witnessed .
but let 's go with order and  |||  start  |||  from the very beginning .
the nonsense began with the collection of the back  |||  number  |||  , which presupposed you went there before the race .
it did not seem a bad idea , but if you 're forced to go , it should be to withdraw all things ( including the chip to  |||  avoid  |||  queues during the race ) .
we went there just to collect the back  |||  number  |||  ( first nonsense , just go for this only reason ) and ( after the queue ) , surprise ! they only had " s " size t - shirts ( second nonsense , because i need an xl ) .
is it to blame the crisis if they bought only  |||  small  |||  t - shirts , made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive ?
well , these things were nothing if compared with the day of the  |||  race  |||  .
we had to go very  |||  early  |||  to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and , furthermore , you had to deposit your backpack .
the wait lasted more than 35 minutes , something incomprehensible for a race where you  |||  expect  |||  more than 11,000 people .
then , as expected , the race  |||  started  |||  when we had not even handed over the backpack , although , once succeeded , the recovery was even worse .
i believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow , and some , like me , not even resulted in the  |||  proper  |||  arrival order because of the chip , which , i suppose , did not record the arrival time properly .
in future , if i will be asked for the  |||  perfect  |||  race , this one wont't certainly enter in my thoughts .
microsoft looks for a (  |||  virtual  |||  ) receptionist
thanks to a camera and a forms and faces ' recognition system , this " receptionist " may know how many people are there in a specific room , who are they -- including  |||  remember  |||  what 's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them .
the demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person , understands he does not belong to the group he is  |||  talking  |||  with and that he is not a company 's employee .
but this is the  |||  future  |||  , of course .
this week it was a big  |||  talk  |||  on microsoft 's change of strategy .
windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many  |||  programs  |||  .
steve ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less  |||  commercial  |||  rubbish , these should be five times faster - hey ! steve , will be for less .
a real discovery , if one takes into account the fact that microsoft , version after version has only added  |||  features  |||  and " extras " to windows .
the change of  |||  direction  |||  is very welcome .
microsoft is right : the  |||  operating  |||  system will be increasingly losing importance , and the software with it .
many rightly pointed out that a  |||  browser  |||  is not an operating system .
it performs the same function of your  |||  wife  |||  or your husband when you have something to say to your mother - in - law .
it 's  |||  true  |||  .
it wo n't ever disappear , perhaps you just need to think about the " death " of the  |||  operating  |||  system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one .
what ballmer said this week confirms this  |||  idea  |||  .
they only use the computer to launch explorer or firefox - or chrome - daily and  |||  spend  |||  a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment .
|||  less  |||  is more .
and windows 7 should be  |||  less  |||  , much less than vista .
less heavy , less loaded , less  |||  complex  |||  .
actually , they desperately need it . let 's take a  |||  little  |||  example .
i shot the photo of this post during the microsoft employees ' break , in redmond ,  |||  earlier  |||  this month .
a sign , hanging on the soft drinks ' machine suggested them to use the company 's search engine - " your  |||  search  |||  . our future " .
in 2006 , an  |||  independent  |||  study reached the conclusion that the 66 % of microsoft employees used google to search on the net .
last week , moreover , microsoft confirmed the  |||  delay  |||  in developing the new version of windows mobile 7 .
microsoft  |||  surely  |||  will try a joint launch , windows 7 and windows mobile 7 together .
but the  |||  delay  |||  , with android and the iphone already on marketing , will result detrimental .
pablo picasso used to dress it while in the french riviera , leonardo di caprio shone with one of this in ' diamante de sangre ' by edward zwick , as well as al pacino in ' the godfather ' of francis ford coppola . moreover , it is  |||  part  |||  of the typical uniform worn by the muscular gay parish .
it is the ' tank ' , as english speakers call it , though , the brussels fabuleux marcel stands out  |||  above  |||  all .
first of all , this is due to its grandiose  |||  name  |||  - even if it is commonly known just as " marcel " - name that has something to do with the sport because it derives , according to the legend , from the boxer marcel cerdan , who loved the singer edith piaf .
the " marcel " excels - if compared to the  |||  others  |||  - for its high quality cotton , for its unisex cutting , for his distinctive little shield and the small belgian flag ( barely recognizable ) , which the most emblematic models keep as a detail on the neck .
and open your eyes ! , because the belgian  |||  company  |||  does not produce only its famous " tank " .
the great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from  |||  developing  |||  a strong personality .
monica cruz is a tiny woman , but still ,  |||  full  |||  of vitality .
i came here to  |||  present  |||  the new collection my sister penelope and i have designed for the new mango autumn - winter season , to join the second edition of ' mango fashion awards ' and the opera dinner in honour of valentino .
what is the inspiration of your new collection for mango in this  |||  fourth  |||  season of work for the spanish fashion house ?
dancer , actress and designer , you 're a very versatile  |||  woman  |||  , are n't you ?
it was so good ! , much  |||  better  |||  than going to the amusement park .
it is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals , to look themselves in the mirror and  |||  feel  |||  good .
and in the actress role , when you are delivered the wardrobe , this is the time you  |||  actually  |||  encounter the character .
so , everything goes together , yes , with a lot of  |||  respect  |||  for designers and professionals .
i 'm not scared by the  |||  biological  |||  clock .
yes , of course , i 'm . i know it is my same  |||  body  |||  pushing me for this and also i want to be a young mom , i 'm not gonna miss it .
i will give my son a lot of happiness and i will educate him with bigger  |||  love  |||  .
talking about cinema , you are waiting the release of some films you acted  |||  last year  |||  .
|||  coming  |||  from the theatrical experience , i am a very impatient and anxious woman , i want everything now and clearly , but i know this may not be always possible .
people usually ignore this naomi 's tender  |||  heart  |||  .
it is said so many things on her , that , knowing her quite well , i can assure you are not  |||  true  |||  .
you cannot back out of helping the third  |||  world  |||  women .
drivers reticent of alcoholism should  |||  install  |||  the ' alcolock '
the interior office wants the driver under three administrative  |||  penalties  |||  for excessive alcoholic rate , to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk . the same if you do not blow into the measuring device .
the measure was announced last june and has been already  |||  included  |||  in the annual report of the state attorney general , according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year .
this project 's goal is the reinstatement of the driver , since he will need to attend a course of  |||  road  |||  re - education .
the initiative is supported by the attorney general for road safety , together with the  |||  general  |||  directorate of traffic ( dgt ) and the technological institute foundation for security in the automobile ( fits ) .
according to  |||  statistics  |||  , between 30 % and 75 % of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving , still drive a car .
the ' alcolock ' would avoid this , because the device ,  |||  connected  |||  to the vehicle , measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it , or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law .
the  |||  cost  |||  of the device , a bit more than 1000 euro , should be charged to the sanctioned .
and in spain it was estimated it could  |||  save  |||  around 115 lives in one year .
the measure is  |||  limited  |||  to administrative sanctions for two reasons : first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses .
and second , to facilitate the implementation of this practice , as the legal reform can be ordinarily made , but , on the contrary , the  |||  necessary  |||  reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law .
the device is not yet available on the  |||  spanish  |||  market in any commercial solution , even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports .
just tomorrow , the congress of deputies will vote a psoe 's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in  |||  school  |||  buses , as has already been done in france .
in line with the  |||  british  |||  punctuality , at 17.40 pm , perfectly on schedule , the spanish airline landed at the presidential hangar of benito juárez airport in mexico city , bringing there the prices of asturias .
the  |||  spanish  |||  ambassador and other authorities stood at the foot of the ladder .
a few hours before i had asked a taxi driver , along the street , if he knew that the  |||  spanish  |||  princes were about visiting the city to formalize an official travel .
- ah , very good , so we cannot go to the  |||  airport  |||  and collect people in that time band ... is she from here or ...
many are those who wait for them at the airport 's hangar , crowded together on the red carpet and closed to a  |||  military  |||  line composed by 27 navy soldiers offering the honour greeting .
the best fashion  |||  award  |||
probably there is not a more  |||  appropriate  |||  place in the world than paris to present a fashion award , and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as valentino .
mango has just presented the  |||  second  |||  edition of el botón - mango fashion awards , to support the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field .
it offers a prize of 300,000  |||  euros  |||  .
yesterday , sandrina fasoli , the belgian winner of the first edition , looked at his drawings in the mango 's window at the  |||  number  |||  54 of boulevard haussmann -- paris , and was almost crying for emotion .
moreover , the company 's store is the second largest in europe , recently  |||  opened  |||  on 1335 square meters ' space .
the most important one is  |||  located  |||  in london .
the proximity of the most exquisite paintings by chagal made the presidential gala  |||  table  |||  prepared by mango even more spectacular .
nati , with a broken  |||  heart  |||  and making a virtue of necessity , because of the recent death of her brother , wore a dress of the company and fashion complements by elah that took your breath away . so , arm in arm with her son luis - a two meters height boy - accompanied valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized .
monica cruz , who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself -- changed her dress for the dinner , wearing a very sensual long black dress . she got very excited when , during the night walk inside the opera house , accompanied by goya toledo , we were  |||  shown  |||  the room for dance recitals , and recalling other times , she grabbed a bar and outlined a " grand plie " .
next morning we welcomed the presence of olivier martinez - another boy who likes moving by motorbike - and john travolta , who arrived at the intercontinental hotel of paris , bringing his own sheets , towels and only after  |||  asking  |||  to have no smells in his room .
stars under the starlit  |||  paris  |||  sky .
1001 , the  |||  number  |||  anti - stress
it is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday  |||  life  |||  .
and if it seems not enough , all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the  |||  relax  |||  to the bookstores by the 30th of september .
the alarm clock is almost a punishment when ringing  |||  every  |||  morning at 7 o'clock , but the worst is imaging yourself involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life .
office means tension , computer  |||  back  |||  pain .
|||  stress  |||  is the illness of the twenty - first century .
however , you are offered now neither one nor two ways to  |||  combat  |||  daily exhaustion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work 's dimension ,
but no more no  |||  less  |||  than 1001 ways .
|||  beyond  |||  yoga positions , the classic massage or the " spa " treatments , susannah marriott collects in the pages of her book , a " menu " full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs .
if someone believes winning the peace in areas such as  |||  business  |||  or personal relationships is not possible , this " manual " denies that belief .
it also suggests alternatives , such as staying in touch with  |||  nature  |||  , or provides 100 % natural recipes that help to relax .
if the adrenaline is not already flowing in your veins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you , it 's time to sit on the couch , turn off your mind and  |||  focus  |||  on reading .
|||  speaking  |||  while sleeping
some children  |||  speak  |||  during the night .
i am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before , but those children who  |||  talk  |||  while asleep .
this is a benign alteration of  |||  sleep  |||  , defined somniloquy .
it is a quite common phenomenon , especially in  |||  children  |||  and adolescents .
there is not a single  |||  reason  |||  to explain the presence of somniloquy .
sometimes it should be linked to other sleep  |||  disorders  |||  such as nightmares , night fears , nocturnal enuresis ( do pee in bed ) , or sleepwalking , but it is not necessarily the case .
as mentioned above , it may be associated with stages of very  |||  high  |||  fever , in situations of stress or over excitement .
in any case , this  |||  phenomenon  |||  is not researched that well .
it may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice , with loose words , almost in a whisper , or the opposite ( screams , cries ,  |||  long  |||  speeches . . . ) .
what you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very  |||  simple  |||  preventive measures , such as :
try not to over - excite the child  |||  before  |||  going to sleep .
propose calm games and  |||  avoid  |||  television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence .
very nervous children for  |||  whom  |||  relaxing is a very hard task , need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm .
this will allow the  |||  child  |||  to sleep more peacefully .
once somniloquy appears , try to  |||  keep  |||  calm .
|||  useful  |||  tips
it is useless , because he is not  |||  aware  |||  of what is going on , and you just interrupt his sleeping .
although he is  |||  talking  |||  , he is asleep and thus , he is resting .
do not get  |||  anything  |||  , because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts .
in addition , you are only able to  |||  hear  |||  what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things . therefore , be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead .
do not  |||  ever  |||  tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets .
in short , do not  |||  worry  |||  , it 's nothing serious , just an episode that lasts few minutes .
illhaeusern ...  |||  finally  |||
illhaeusern has finally regained its path to victory on its own soil after a  |||  long  |||  period of draught .
without playing a great match , the yellow and black have  |||  created  |||  the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner .
after a first attempt by the guest captain kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal from a far shot , illhaeusern went on to take a slight lead and in turn fonderflick from afar , then with hirn from high , romain with the tip of his foot or again diebold came to tickle the dannemarie  |||  defence  |||  .
the beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by riahi and temporale for dannemarie , immediately after the score was  |||  opened  |||  for illhaeuserns by marais , well positioned to pick up a ball bounced off an initial attempt by diebold ( 53 ' ) .
sarkozy meets angry  |||  fishermen  |||  .
before leaving for the  |||  united  |||  states , nicolas sarkozy is going to make a trip to brittany .
facing the display of force by the fishermen who on monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in brittany and normandy , on tuesday morning at guilvinec port , in finistère , the president of the republic has decided to yield and to  |||  meet  |||  their representatives .
the latter have  |||  promised  |||  to accept " with a constructive spirit " and they hope he " will arrive with practical proposals " .
a presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the " crisis committee "  |||  created  |||  by fishermen in brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil , which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 euro per litre .
according to the elysée spokesman david martinon , the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and  |||  secure  |||  employment conditions and sailors ' remuneration "
nicolas sarkozy is expected with determination by the  |||  fishermen  |||  .
on tuesday morning , they conducted slow driving operations in the morbihan and calvados ,  |||  causing  |||  traffic jams for almost 10 km.
the leisure craft harbour of quiberon was also  |||  blocked  |||  , but the roads to belle - isle were not blocked .
the sailors have already  |||  shown  |||  their determination on monday by burning , since dawn , tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of brest and lorient , while demonstrations were taking place in concarneau or saint - brieuc .
the movement has spread to other ports on the atlantic coast and on the channel , such as sables d'olonne in vendée , where trawlers  |||  remained  |||  docked at the quayside or le havre , where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships .
fishermen in la turballe and croisic , in loire - atlantique , in the evening stopped the blockade of the important  |||  total  |||  refinery at donges .
those at boulogne - sur - mer have decided to wait until after the  |||  meeting  |||  at the ministry on wednesday to decide on possible actions .

with 228 votes against and 205 for , the delegates have refused to treasury  |||  secretary  |||  henry paulson the resources he asked for .
nearly two out of three republicans  |||  rejected  |||  his plan .
" this is a bad signal for the market , which saw the congress failing to  |||  adopt  |||  a plan , " said lindsey piegża of ftn financial .
" this shows how much the market relied on this plan , " she added , fearing that a draft  |||  adopted  |||  in several days time can be " too late " .
" if the project is effectively dead ( . . . ) then the relay will be quickly passed to the fed ( i.e. the u.s. central bank ) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the  |||  credit  |||  conditions " , predicted brian bethune , chief economist at global insight .
and further accentuating the sense of urgency , " each day that passes sees the  |||  fall  |||  of another financial institution " in the united states , emphasised mrs piegża .

obama , who won on  |||  points  |||  the first televised duel
to the first  |||  debate  |||  on friday between the two candidates for the white house has succeeded another to see who , john mccain or barack obama , won .
not surprisingly , the campaign headquarters of the republicans and the democrats have  |||  declared  |||  their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of american families .
the political analyst david gergen believes that john mccain 's performance , though admirable , was not " brilliant " enough to  |||  enable  |||  it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election .
according to a cbs poll , among the undecided voters , who are those that count ,  |||  obama  |||  has won 39 % of respondents , while 25 % of them give victory to mccain .
obama should be able to confirm his  |||  lead  |||  on thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate , joseph biden , during the first and only public debate with his rival , sarah palin .
" it would be a mistake to  |||  underestimate  |||  her .
she has good instincts nonetheless " , warned  |||  bill  |||  clinton this weekend .
the septuagenarian mccain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy , while stressing the " naivety " of his opponent on these  |||  issues  |||  that were at the heart of this initial face - to - face debate .
" senator obama does not  |||  seem  |||  to understand that . . . " he accused several times .
an angle of attack hammered yesterday in  |||  republican  |||  television advertisements .
obama , himself , has  |||  stressed  |||  that he represented the future .
he put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the united  |||  states  |||  in the world .
" mccain has never understood , while obama , if " , argued this weekend , a democratic spot criticizing the republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "  |||  american  |||  on the streets " .
he did not even utter the words " middle class " or " workers " . " the financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to obama , who is considered by americans as the most likely to  |||  save  |||  the economy on the brink of a precipice .
the democratic representative rahm emanuel , an alumnus of the clinton administration , compared the " good  |||  economic  |||  instincts " of obama to those of bill clinton during the 1998 financial crisis .
reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95 % of the americans despite the turmoil on wall street , the senator from illinois also reported that the achievement of the country 's energy independence by  |||  promoting  |||  renewable energy was his first priority , together with the establishment of a system of health insurance .
cautious , both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars ( 470 billion euro )  |||  adopted  |||  yesterday by congress and extremely unpopular .
in minsk , " have you noticed that there was an  |||  election  |||  , have you ? "
a few hundred belarusians gathered on sunday evening at the  |||  closing  |||  of polling stations in the central square of minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections .
while no results have as yet been announced , many young people came to  |||  demonstrate  |||  against the power of president alexander lukashenko : " the dictator , resignation . "
they do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in  |||  order  |||  to resume discussions with the european union is ready to take a democratic turn .
the sanctions , which include  |||  visa  |||  bans for 40 belarusian officials and the freezing of assets , could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers .
they have not been according to the  |||  opposition  |||  .
" we were  |||  kept  |||  away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count , " lamented yuri potemkin , the spokesperson for the union of democratic forces , a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties .
" it 's a cosmetic change , emphasizes alexander milinkevich , a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro - european movement , because it 's who counts the votes that is important , and here , that is the executive  |||  power  |||  .
if opposition members enter parliament , it is because they have been appointed , not  |||  elected  |||  .
but their entry into parliament could mean space on television , meetings in the regions , and  |||  proposed  |||  laws . "
the opposition should therefore enter the political game because " we must  |||  open  |||  a dialogue with the european union .
because if our economy which is heavily in debt with russia , enters into a crisis , and if we do not reform ourselves , we  |||  risk  |||  becoming a protectorate of russia .
we want to be  |||  independent  |||  " .
" have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? queries the social democratic  |||  leader  |||  alexander kozulin , one of two political prisoners released in august this year .
on television , president lukashenko and members of the central  |||  election  |||  committee welcomed their success .
and most importantly , it has regained the confidence of the  |||  public  |||  who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s .
in quebec , the  |||  committee  |||  gélineau has fulfilled that mandate .
" in 1998 , when héma - québec  |||  began  |||  operations , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the blood system in quebec , remembers dr. décary .
the  |||  situation  |||  was discouraging .
at that time , there were in europe with the outbreak of a  |||  number  |||  of cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new variant of the creutzfeldt - jakob disease , said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998 .
" and we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through  |||  blood  |||  .
it was then based on one of the main recommendations of the krever and gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a  |||  serious  |||  illness may result , in this case creutzfeldt - jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death , one establishes an excluding action .
in april 1999 , the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the uk since 1980 was  |||  refused  |||  .
this episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made  |||  sense  |||  . "
in 1999 , on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for hiv testing : the nucleic acid testing ( nat )  |||  allowed  |||  to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus , which is what previous tests were based on .
it was able to  |||  reduce  |||  that period to less than a week .
thus , it has substantially  |||  reduced  |||  the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them .
today , a person in 12 million is at  |||  risk  |||  of receiving hiv contaminated blood .
since héma - quebec  |||  each  |||  year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of hiv transmission through a blood product occurs .
" our challenge for the  |||  next  |||  decade is to maintain the safety of our products .
as recently as  |||  last  |||  year , there appeared on the island of reunion the chikungunya virus which , like the west nile virus , is transmitted by an insect in the blood .
we must be constantly vigilant , " continues dr. décary before emphasizing that in addition to a  |||  secure  |||  supply , héma - québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities .
the treatments being more aggressive ,  |||  patients  |||  often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets .
the aging  |||  population  |||  also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 % of quebecers eligible to donate blood . "
any  |||  healthy  |||  person , aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days , six times a year .
on average , 14 % of those offering their blood are not  |||  accepted  |||  because they have aids or malaria , for example , and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife , they would be excluded for a period of one year .
" with these 3 % , we manage to  |||  maintain  |||  an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals .
the shortages are very  |||  rare  |||  .
but we must renew the  |||  members  |||  of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood .
it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood , but even more so to retain them and  |||  encourage  |||  them to become regular donors .
with an annual budget of $ 297 million , héma - québec provides not only blood products , but also tissues , including bone grafts , heart valves , eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for  |||  large  |||  burns .
the umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat  |||  serious  |||  diseases such as leukaemia .
" a few weeks ago , we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord  |||  blood  |||  and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year .
we should  |||  start  |||  to propose transplants at the beginning of next year , " says dr. décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular .
" many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it " because héma - québec cannot afford to offer this  |||  complex  |||  and expensive program in all hospitals in quebec .
|||  soccer  |||  - impact in the semi - finals
the midfielder antonio ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th  |||  minute  |||  on thursday .
impact will face the whitecaps on friday and sunday , but the details of the series will be  |||  confirmed  |||  today .
the canadian number one trio is ready for the  |||  season  |||  .
the unit consisting of alex kovalev , tomas plekanec and andrei kostitsyn led the attack for a canadian win of 3-2 in a shootout against the florida panthers  |||  last  |||  night at the bell centre .
" i am not yet  |||  ready  |||  , warned the russian .
i need another  |||  match  |||  to feel at ease . "
" he tried to do too much in the first period , guy carbonneau  |||  noted  |||  .
but i think he  |||  appreciated  |||  the way the match ended .
charest placed on the  |||  north  |||
the  |||  prime minister  |||  does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year
once the general council of the liberal party finished , jean charest yesterday visited jean - talon , quebec city , where the new health minister , yves bolduc (  |||  left  |||  ) is trying to get elected in the by - election today .
" pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier " : this is the long - term ambition that jean charest  |||  presented  |||  with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the general council of the liberal party of quebec , in levis yesterday .
rotating in a loop on three huge screens , were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams , mining developments , of quebec  |||  seen  |||  through " google maps " , maps , etc.
moreover , as a point to emphasise , the prime minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this  |||  fall  |||  , although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy .
the " north plan " is the fourth part of a " vision " that the  |||  prime minister  |||  claims to have for quebec , that of a " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on labour with france , an agreement between canada and europe , and agreements with ontario .
often mentioned in the speeches of the  |||  prime minister  |||  recently , the opening of the north - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  had however to explain why the north was " a jewel with an immense potential " , but never given its due chance , investment money , or specific priority in future projects .
the north contains " nickel , zinc , copper , platinum ,  |||  gold  |||  , silver , iron , titanium , and even diamonds " , according to mr. charest 's list .
this territory is twice the size of  |||  france  |||  " , " it is here with us , it is in quebec .
not only is it with us , but it 's also us " , he insisted , to better  |||  show  |||  this he solicited a national founding myth .
the province has  |||  built  |||  much by its relationship with the north , he said : the gold rush in abitibi , quebec engineering , james 's bay .
" we , our future , " he  |||  added  |||  after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him .
" this is a traditional  |||  position  |||  that all governments have reiterated .
there is a border along which there has been no agreement for too  |||  long  |||  a time and , when the opportunity arises , i reiterate this position there on behalf of government " , he said .
in this new geopolitical context , the  |||  prime minister  |||  considers occupying the territory a duty .
and the inhabitants of the territory , first  |||  nations  |||  and inuit ?
the prime minister said that the quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would  |||  benefit  |||  them , especially to young people .
two former ministers from two  |||  different  |||  parties , pierre corbeil and michel létourneau ( former member ungava pq ) , have already started consultations with thirty communities .
an inter - ministerial committee chaired by benoit pelletier , in which julie boulet ( transport and  |||  natural  |||  resources ) has an important place , started work .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  has not excluded holding a big meeting , " not necessarily a summit , " but a time when " we give ourselves a common vision . "
northern development would also be consistent with the principles of  |||  sustainable  |||  development .
jean charest  |||  described  |||  this " vision " as continuous with that of the liberal prime minister who preceded him .
this has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend , which was  |||  launched  |||  friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of jean lesage at the head of the party .
one of the resolutions  |||  proposed  |||  to rename the central beauharnois dam in adélard - godbout .
in the press briefing , he invoked another reference , conservative as this , the program " roads to the north " by john diefenbaker ,  |||  prime minister  |||  from 1957 to 1963 .
" between us , but i plan to be there , " he told activists , eliciting from them a  |||  huge  |||  round of applause .
indeed , the prime minister , who said in april that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this  |||  fall  |||  , it is what the law permits him .
he  |||  stressed  |||  that his schedule is filled up , notably by a mission to the federation council in china and a quebec - new york summit .
the weekend 's general council  |||  provided  |||  the liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions , notably some " constitutional aspirations " which passed through like a breeze : the plq in particular calls for the recognition of the " specificity of quebec in the constitution .
it also wants quebec to be able to appoint members of the canadian  |||  radio  |||  and telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in quebec .
on the opposition side , the outline of the northern plan was  |||  received  |||  with scepticism .
the pq leader , pauline marois , has brought up again the policy development of northern quebec that the landry government had  |||  launched  |||  in 2001 .
according to her , the liberal government , when it came into  |||  power  |||  in 2003 , had waived the application .
the adq has  |||  supported  |||  the adoption of the north plan by the government .
it is mr. vic toews , former minister of justice " ( oh irony ) in the harper cabinet , which  |||  allowed  |||  himself last summer to say that louise arbor was a " shame " for canada .
a  |||  government  |||  which ignores the fact that omar khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged .
the only  |||  government  |||  that , despite the fact that canada has signed the geneva convention , has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier .
remember , for the record , that unicef , amnesty international and the canadian bar association , among others , pleaded for the repatriation of omar khadr so that he receives a  |||  fair  |||  trial in canada .
this same government turns a blind eye to torture :  |||  little  |||  does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed , doubtlessly forever , after so many years of abuses .
one does not yet realise , but we are witnessing  |||  right  |||  now a creeping erosion of our rights , of our liberties , and our " democracy " , this word that harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth .
now comes the time when there are no more morals : one can bully , torture , arbitrarily detain a canadian citizen at the whim of the head of a minor government so far ( so what will  |||  happen  |||  so after 14 october . . . ) .
a number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue , law , and  |||  order  |||  : they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country .
free  |||  opinion  |||  - the orwellian speech barrick gold
in its september 17 edition , le devoir published a letter from mr patrick j. garver ,  |||  executive  |||  vice - president of the canadian mining barrick gold .
following an orwellian logic , it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in  |||  order  |||  to launch a " transparent public debate " .
while it is  |||  true  |||  that the judges are independent and impartial , especially in the cases of defamation , they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law .
not surprisingly , this difference is  |||  completely  |||  obscured by mr. garver .
since , for barrick gold , the best way for it to conduct a public  |||  debate  |||  is to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position ?
regardless of the trial 's outcome , the authors and publisher of the book black canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight , with very unequal resources , against an army of lawyers  |||  supported  |||  by the almost bottomless pockets of mining .
thus , it would have been sufficient for the mining company to  |||  open  |||  its books , records and establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
but barrick gold  |||  appears  |||  not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of black canada .
perhaps mr garver could explain how he can both call for a " public "  |||  debate  |||  while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience ?
in a democracy , even the critics have the  |||  right  |||  to speak .
what barrick gold does not - or will not -  |||  understand  |||  is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of black canada , does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods .
the public is ready to hear barrick and judge , but on the basis of a civilized  |||  exchange  |||  of arguments , and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution - gag ( continuing the " public debate " , barrick gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of black canada demanding them to cease their use of the term . . . ) .
it denies , collectively , the right to quote from  |||  credible  |||  sources and debate on the facts and interpretations , which represents the very basis of intellectual work .
if it is impossible to study and  |||  discuss  |||  subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in the world in a country like canada , under penalty of repeated prosecution , who can do it ?
she has a  |||  right  |||  to reply .
the academia , to which we belong , has long been managing the  |||  debates  |||  and disagreements , and resolving conflicts .
barrick gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that , contrary to its claims , it did not want a transparent  |||  debate  |||  .
the bush administration and  |||  leaders  |||  of congress , both the republicans and the democrats , finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the great depression of the 30s .
in particular , it foresees : a better control by elected officials of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed , new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non - payment , as well as a right to look at the salaries  |||  paid  |||  to executives of companies rescued .
u.s. treasury secretary , henry paulson , the chairman of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi , and republican representative to the  |||  negotiating  |||  table , senator judd gregg , announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday , following a marathon two - day negotiations .
" we have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market , "  |||  declared  |||  the representative of the bush administration , henry paulson .
" everything has been done in order to shield the  |||  real  |||  economy and ordinary americans from the current crisis on wall street , " said the democrat .
" this is the fundamental  |||  point  |||  : if we do not do this , the trauma , chaos and disruption on the daily lives of americans will be immense , " declared republican judd gregg .
the negotiations turned into a sprint in the  |||  final  |||  hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors .
the deadline we had given was the  |||  opening  |||  of the markets this morning .
associated late to the negotiations , the two  |||  american  |||  presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme .
democratic senator barack obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly those that enable owners to  |||  keep  |||  their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state .
" when you ask taxpayers to take  |||  extraordinary  |||  measures because of the irresponsibility of some , there is nothing to congratulate .
but these measures are  |||  necessary  |||  , " he commented on the airwaves of american television .
asked by another channel whether he will vote for the  |||  proposed  |||  plan , his republican opponent , john mccain , responded : " i would like to see the details , but i hope so . "
" the outline that i  |||  read  |||  [ show ] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards .
the option of doing nothing is  |||  simply  |||  not acceptable " , he said .
the plan of 700 billion  |||  aims  |||  to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts , assets at risk and unsellable u.s. financial institutions .
it comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages ( subprime ) before spreading to other forms of more  |||  widespread  |||  credit titles ( pcaa ) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions .
this is a group of elected republicans who had derailed the first draft  |||  agreement  |||  last week .
it is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the democrats have agreed that certain " toxic " shares of companies in  |||  difficulty  |||  are only insured by the government , rather than purchased .
to round off the corners for everyone in congress , a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program , it could introduce new taxes to  |||  help  |||  recover its investment .
the new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the president deems  |||  necessary  |||  .
in  |||  exchange  |||  for its support , washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued , earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed .
the federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages  |||  paid  |||  to executives of companies affected .
the architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the  |||  house  |||  of representatives today , and the senate on wednesday .
despite all their efforts , it is not yet  |||  certain  |||  that their plan will get the green light .
" obviously , washington does not hear you , " said while addressing his constituents the republican scott garrett , a member of the finance committee of the  |||  house  |||  .
" yes , we have a serious financial  |||  problem  |||  .
yes , solutions do  |||  exist  |||  .
at the same time , europe has once again demonstrated the  |||  global  |||  nature of the crisis .
after an  |||  emergency  |||  meeting , the three benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group fortis for 11.2 billion euro ( 16.3 billion u.s. ) .
the intervention of the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg had been made  |||  necessary  |||  after the french bank bnp paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion euro ( 2.9 billion u.s. ) in the risky mortgages crisis in the united states .
fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest  |||  european  |||  banks and the ten largest insurers .
in return , we get the  |||  right  |||  to vote with the bank and some influence .
it 's just something that investors and households  |||  appreciate  |||  now that uncertain times are ahead . "
meanwhile ,  |||  across  |||  the channel , the british government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis .
according to the  |||  english  |||  press , the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank bradford and bingley , including more than 41 billion ( 75.5 billion u.s. ) in real estate loans .
the spanish bank santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the  |||  british  |||  bank .
the bradford and bingley would be the second bank , after the northern rock , the  |||  british  |||  government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis .
