therefore , i call on the commission to transpose what is agreed in nagoya into proposals that can be measured and monitored and to develop a long - term vision , so that , in 2011 , we do not need to say once  |||  again  |||  that we have been unable to halt biodiversity loss .

american views of the muslim world are so colored by the conflict in the middle east and the wars in iraq and  |||  afghanistan  |||  that us citizens have no collective appreciation of the fact that most muslims live in asia . or that the four countries with the largest muslim populations -- indonesia , pakistan , india , and bangladesh -- are all cultures with millennia - old histories of coexisting with other religions and cultures .
much of this progress was  |||  achieved  |||  during the cold war , proving that it is possible to create global legal norms even in times of deep political division .
this is not the time for restricting  |||  actions  |||  to the national level .
in fact , the increase in obesity  |||  among  |||  children is quite alarming in europe .

i voted in favour of this document , which states that the agreement of 26 october 2004 concluded with the swiss confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a member state or in switzerland ( the ' dublin  |||  agreement  |||  with switzerland ' ) provides for the possible association of liechtenstein with the dublin acquis by means of a protocol .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would firstly like to congratulate the committee chair , brian simpson , for leading the work of the committee and work on the file , and , above all , for having  |||  allowed  |||  its conclusion - at least i hope so because the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) will be voting for this - and approval on first reading , and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation .
the fund establishes the possibility of granting aid to those  |||  affected  |||  by natural disasters that cause considerable damage .
monitoring of the use of external experts by the  |||  agencies  |||  must be enabled .
they , too , had a good deal of positive input to offer and we were only a couple of small unresolved issues away from reaching an  |||  agreement  |||  at first reading , although it is , in any case , that bit more democratic to have a vote in the house first .
the fact that it has been  |||  adopted  |||  by a large majority confirms the importance given to improving the use of european funds .
on that point , i  |||  agree  |||  with the previous speaker .
in writing . - ( pt ) this proposal should be in line with the reasons behind the 6th environment  |||  action  |||  programme with the aim of applying current knowledge of prospective and retrospective strategies for assessing the risks and dangers to humans and the environment and to create coherency with other policies .

in particular , the need for better coordination between the different member states , the necessary improvement of the quality of the information that is exchanged , the need to allow other member states automated  |||  access  |||  to certain data contained in member states ' databases and the requirement to harmonise registration and deregistration procedures are ideas that are strongly supported by the commission .
i voted for this resolution on the european union 's strategy for the copenhagen summit on climate change as i am convinced that a comprehensive international  |||  agreement  |||  can actually alter the trend of uncontrolled growth in greenhouse gas emissions .
this is currently a subject of disagreement , and we would insist most emphatically that half - measures and relaxed criteria should not be  |||  agreed  |||  to , in view of either crises or normal human error .
therefore , i think it is absolutely vital that all members of this parliament urge the commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that i mean proposals which would  |||  allow  |||  every region across europe that qualifies , to access structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future .

disparities in health between countries , between regions , between rich and poor , between different ethnic minorities ,  |||  affect  |||  each and every eu member state and , in many places , they are getting wider .

it is important to me that these cultural driving forces have optimum  |||  access  |||  to the new digital and audiovisual formats .

today , the european parliament  |||  adopted  |||  an historic and particularly important directive strengthening the fight against trafficking in human beings .
the latter is fully taken into account in our common efforts to design an improved ets , and the position of those industries will certainly be considered in the context of any international  |||  agreement  |||  that is negotiated and the implications for european industries , particularly energy - intensive ones , if we do not create the level playing field that we are seeking through negotiation .
it means that next year , if the growth figures collapse again , we will stand up in front of everyone and have no  |||  answer  |||  to the economic situation .

economic reforms have progressed ,  |||  allowing  |||  for a steady growth of the tunisian economy as well as of trade volume with the eu .

without calling into question the importance of the work done by the acp - eu joint parliamentary assembly ( jpa ) in 2009 or its undeniable contribution to development cooperation , i cannot fail to express my concern about the content of point 6 of the joly report : ' encourages the jpa to continue to work on this area and to explore  |||  additional  |||  and innovative sources of financing for development , such as an international financial transaction tax ' .
many warlords are indeed carrying on their struggle , often with foreign ( and even  |||  american  |||  ) backing .

in view of recent developments in the situation and by  |||  agreement  |||  with the political groups , i would like to propose the following changes to the order of business on wednesday .
on this front , the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important , above all , because in a number of cases , the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions , further increasing the importance of effective and  |||  adequate  |||  support for less developed regions in europe , combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus .
as mr van orden said , at least the african union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him , and that gives us here in the european union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure , firstly , that mr mugabe stops the arrests and the executions , and secondly , that the constitution is  |||  accepted  |||  for the freedom of the zimbabwean people , which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in zimbabwe .

we  |||  adopted  |||  the euro after only five years of membership in the eu and as prime minister fico said on new year 's day , we could see the euro as a lucky talisman bringing us stability and the potential for slovakia to develop even more vigorously in this time of economic crisis .

that being the case , if we cannot reach an agreement with korea , would the commission accept that dg trade might as well pack up and go home as regards free trade agreements , because if we cannot  |||  agree  |||  with korea we are not going to agree with india , asean or on any other such agreements we are negotiating ?
i am  |||  actually  |||  very hopeful that trade will begin to play a larger role in this parliament .
the presidency of a state that has emerged from a communist dictatorship - and this should not be belittled - with a prime minister who was himself a victim of this dictatorship , is in fact a presidency that not only deserves the full support of all democrats , but also has a great opportunity to recapture the hearts of the people  |||  again  |||  because it gives us here in parliament as well as in europe the opportunity once again to show that change is possible and in the long run freedom always prevails and democracy will always triumph !

when it comes to emissions trading , the  |||  agreement  |||  reached on solidarity with the new member states from central and eastern europe and on taking into account their efforts during the period after 1990 is evidence of the viability of the european values which made europe attractive to a large number of peoples .

madam president , allow me to say that we demand that regulations which apply to goods produced in the european union also be  |||  adopted  |||  by countries which export to the european union .
thus in view of such occurrences , i am very reluctant to  |||  accept  |||  the transfer of personal data from one country to another .

the pentagon reports that  |||  american  |||  army drillmasters do " less shouting at everyone , " because today 's generation responds better to instructors who play " a more counseling - type role . "

the european initiative to create the galileo and european geostationary navigation overlay service ( egnos ) programmes will not only enable europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs , but ,  |||  above  |||  all , will also bring improvements to the daily lives of europeans , and will generate direct and indirect benefits for the european economy .

modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which ,  |||  above  |||  all in the last few decades , new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations .

mr president , lest we forget that there are people  |||  affected  |||  by these problems , i met a young irishman on the flight to frankfurt today , on his way to australia with a one - way ticket , and he is just one of thousands who are doing this because of our economic and banking problems .
for all these reasons we must raise our voices and call firstly on the political parties to condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by their followers , and secondly on the government itself to reopen spaces for democratic participation , to respect freedom of expression , to stop banning marches , and to  |||  allow  |||  all ngos to receive international cooperation aid and not only aid from venezuela for pro - government associations .

( mt ) please  |||  allow  |||  me to start by congratulating the council for the courageous conclusions it reached last week .
financial corrections to agricultural payments , such as those deriving from the commission 's  |||  annual  |||  clearance decisions in the framework of the balancing procedure , relate to large sums , which the member states have to repay to the community budget as corrections or financial penalties because of their failure to establish adequate control systems .
in poland , the two are combined in a denunciation of the " original sin " of the 1989 compromise between moderate dissident elites and moderate communist elites , which enabled a non - violent exit from communism , but  |||  allegedly  |||  allowed the ex - communists to convert their political power into economic power .

( sl ) i am pleased that the first meeting of the council to be held  |||  according  |||  to the rules of the treaty of lisbon is upon us .
in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i express my full support for the decision to at least leave the agriculture budget unchanged and i - like many of my colleagues in the agri committee - am strongly opposed to the  |||  amendment  |||  tabled by the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) which would accept possible future cuts in agriculture resources in order to fund other activities .
the position  |||  achieved  |||  by the euro in the international markets brings undoubted benefits , such as better protection from external shocks .
( pl ) madam president , thank you for this report and for the negotiations that have been undertaken ,  |||  although  |||  i must say i feel somewhat dissatisfied .
rapporteur . - ( fi ) mr president , the voting list also has  |||  amendment  |||  8 replaced with amendment 14 .
we also , however , need the cooperation of the  |||  african  |||  union and the arab league , which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof .
every orthodox economist would suggest that what we need to do at a time like this is to  |||  allow  |||  some of the eurozone economies to print their own currencies again , to devalue , to buy themselves time to price themselves back into the market .
lastly , i fully  |||  agree  |||  with mrs berès 's call for quality jobs .
currency union cannot be separated - even  |||  according  |||  to the science of economics - from fiscal union , and the latter cannot exist without political union .
the march organisers were also detained and interrogated  |||  along  |||  with mr milinkiewicz and mrs kazulin , who had not participated in the march .
we need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms , create a euro -  |||  american  |||  assembly and , most importantly , create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world - the middle east , iran , afghanistan - and relations with the emerging powers .
we have come out emphatically in favour of an integrated strategy that takes  |||  account  |||  of all possible means of reducing co2 emissions .
this means ,  |||  above  |||  all , that the much - vaunted middle classes are being asked -- or soon will be asked -- to contribute more toward the costs of these services , either by higher taxes or through privatisation of the financial burdens .
these include : amendment 11 on demographic trends ,  |||  amendment  |||  25 stressing the need for better harmonisation between working and family life , amendment 50 on support for member states in promoting part - time work , amendment 35 on optional maternity leave before birth , amendment 53 clarifying that women on maternity leave may have their salaries raised , and amendment 56 on workers ' retirement rights .
i am sorry but i cannot reopen the debate on a comparative  |||  analysis  |||  of two resolutions .
right at the start of this crisis , we in the european parliament were  |||  among  |||  the first to sound the alarm of the damaging consequences that the crisis might have on women unless adequate measures were taken .
the ecb continues to be exclusively preoccupied by inflation and budgets -- problems which the united states solved  |||  almost  |||  ten years ago during the bush administration and which also in europe continue to obsess us only by reason of limited intellectual agility .
if we cannot  |||  answer  |||  this question , google , i am afraid , will be the only player able to meet the needs of the libraries themselves .
|||  although  |||  it has not been part of the debate , i would also like to put on record my personal support for an opt - out rather than an opt - in system for organ donation .
three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with  |||  america  |||  , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and unethical , if not destabilizing , force in the world .
i also  |||  agree  |||  with the need to prolong workers ' careers through a modern employment policy and improvement of working conditions , and i agree with the need to make pension systems and the information provided to citizens more transparent .
through this report , the european parliament explicitly asks the council and the european commission to take better account of agricultural interests in international trade negotiations , particularly in discussions with south america , a large livestock farming and grain production region which does not  |||  always  |||  meet european quality standards .
the tragedy is that the  |||  african  |||  national congress , south africa 's dominant political party , was so much in thrall to mbeki that he was not deposed many years ago .
we were  |||  always  |||  of one mind in setting objectives for the european institute of technology : we want to strengthen europe 's capacity for innovation .
at first , us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld declared this international  |||  agreement  |||  inapplicable .
ladies and gentlemen , allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to mrs lynne , whose report , which is currently being discussed here , is without doubt an important element of the global effort to ensure progress  |||  across  |||  the european union .
as the rapporteur bairbre de brún stated , that support was worth eur 1.65 billion and there is still  |||  another  |||  eur 333 million to come .
on the positive side , a tragic legacy of  |||  american  |||  history has been transcended .
if we have  |||  another  |||  csdp mission and another round of stability instrument training without a political process leading somewhere , i do not think it will help us .
( ro ) madam president , the eu 's industrial policy must create an  |||  adequate  |||  framework for boosting the industrial sector 's contribution to eu gdp .
to tackle these problems , we came up with an " open data / information liquidity " project , which will advocate and organize the publication , exchange , aggregation , and  |||  analysis  |||  of health data -- not just general statistics , but specific data about health outcomes in terms of drugs and treatments , hospital performance , and the like .
it is no  |||  accident  |||  that the main cradle of this strategy is the body : foucault says that through the political technology of the body we can read the shared history of power relations .
this report presents the basic obstacles to the correct use of the structural funds and how they can be overcome , using a series of criteria to classify certain projects and  |||  actions  |||  as best practice and referring to the lack of a commonly acceptable definition of best practice .
we have managed to finish the debate on time and ,  |||  above  |||  all , in the calm atmosphere required so that we can all listen to each other .
mr president , once  |||  again  |||  , i would like to express my very sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs , especially those present - mrs ulrike rodust , mr kuhn and mr ferreira , and also to mr kuhn and mr alain cadec , for their warm and kind words on the subject of my report .
thus , we have  |||  adopted  |||  some conclusions that advance the goals and instruments of the commission and the member states in eradicating violence against women .
recently mr lukashenko expressed the desire to stand  |||  again  |||  for the presidency .
the general context is that the circumstances under which the budget for 2011 will be  |||  adopted  |||  are very challenging because the margin under heading 5 is very limited and because the successful implementation of the treaty of lisbon is the priority for all the european institutions .
the most important thing is to strive for this three - way alliance , which is necessary in order to reach an  |||  agreement  |||  , and to propose , from the outset , a 30 % reduction in emissions .
normally one does not allow a single member or two members to create a political group ; it is necessary  |||  always  |||  to define what that threshold should be .
of course , i cannot but  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur mr trakatellis 's assertion that the draft applies to diseases which may be rare but which afflict thousands of people .
it was also  |||  agreed  |||  that all national protective measures would have to be fully in compliance with the provisions of the ec treaty on state aid and the internal market .
i therefore wish to draw the attention of those fellow members who object to the principle of preferential treatment and who propose  |||  amendments  |||  seeking to remove the establishment of this principle from the report to the fact that , as a hungarian citizen and in the name of the citizens of all the new member states , i consider it unacceptable not to establish firmly the principle that workers from member states are given preference over workers from third countries .
consequently , i would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are  |||  adequate  |||  resources of the relevant kind in place , so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them , because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business .
in addition , the fact that the wet grip values for tyres will , in future , be improved again is something that is to be viewed as a positive development , as is the fact that tyre pressure monitoring systems , lane departure warning systems and  |||  advanced  |||  emergency braking systems are to be considered for other categories of vehicle .
a radioactive leak , the rupture of an undersea oil well and ,  |||  above  |||  all , co2 emissions do not threaten just one country .
the proposal for a directive on which the european parliament was consulted is  |||  another  |||  example of how europe is able to act in a practical manner to protect european citizens .
we have to  |||  actually  |||  have some mechanism for settling disputes .
in particular , moreover , we in parliament are  |||  agreed  |||  that neither the commission 's preliminary draft budget nor the council 's draft - which , as we know , has pruned back the appropriations for both commitments and payments contained in the commission 's estimates , is particularly inspiring .
the prospect of joining the eu has  |||  always  |||  been of great importance for the whole country , that is , for its ethnic groups as well , whether large or small .
there is not yet an agreement that extends to direct investments in energy - related activities carried out on the investor 's own  |||  account  |||  in the secondary sector , such as mining , refining , energy generation and energy distribution .
if populations are compared between 1970 and 2010 , which is when there is monitoring data , the population of bluefin tuna is  |||  above  |||  15 % .
in writing . - i enthusiastically supported the  |||  amendment  |||  proposing to reduce the two september part - sessions to one .
under the prüm council decision , member states grant each other limited  |||  access  |||  to their dna and fingerprint databases in order to check for matches .
mr president of the council , i  |||  agree  |||  with you , of course , that there is a moral crisis , of that there can be no doubt .
however ,  |||  above  |||  all , we need to attract women to the rural world and prevent the exodus that is occurring increasingly , because the position of women in our society progresses slowly , but at least it is progressing in the urban world .
is extending working time and raising the retirement age , i wonder , the right response to increased competitiveness , rather than what we believe : a better salary and secure working conditions that will contribute to productivity , and will ,  |||  above  |||  all , improve living standards ?
i wholeheartedly  |||  agree  |||  with her arguments , and i also hope that they will influence her group tomorrow when it votes on our amendments to this report .
nonetheless , i did not vote in favour because , like other free trade agreements concluded by the eu , it does not take into  |||  account  |||  the precarious situation of the agricultural labourers in developing countries , or the negative impact on the population .
it is a solid report that will reflect realities even better if  |||  amendments  |||  15 and 16 by the rapporteur are adopted , for instance concerning the timetable of the process .
by the way ,  |||  according  |||  to the treaty , it is the council which authorises the signature of the agreements , but parliament always has the last word .
foreign governments began to change these polities after  |||  al-qaeda  |||  in iraq bombed three hotels in amman , jordan , in november 2005 , killing 60 people .
i myself have come because you are the democratic voice of the european people , that is ,  |||  almost  |||  500 million people .
i did not shake hands ,  |||  although  |||  both karadzic and mladic tried to .
corrigendum to a text  |||  adopted  |||  : see minutes
the european commission has confirmed on several occasions that some neighbouring countries - ukraine , russia , sweden and turkey - are ready to join the european stress test programme , but it is still unclear what specific  |||  action  |||  the commission intends to take to bring about cooperation , and how the situation will pan out with regard to belarus .
mobilisation of globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund : application egf / 2010/027 nl / north brabant division 18 / netherlands (
commissioner , we have just received mrs fischer boel 's proposal in relation to the cap health check , and neither health nor animal welfare are recipients of the funds to be  |||  allocated  |||  to rural development to deal with the new challenges , contrary to what the services were apparently expecting , or so i was told .
the assent was positive : it  |||  agreed  |||  to israel 's participation in the community programme , given that it was already participating in the seventh framework programme for research , that its application related solely to the ' innovation and technology ' programme , that all member countries of the neighbourhood policy are entitled to apply to participate , and thus that it constituted neither a special favour to israel nor a reassessment of its political status .
the background to the events of the last few days have been the aggressive  |||  actions  |||  of the kremlin , which aims to extend its domination in the region of south - eastern europe .
mr president , latin  |||  america  |||  has a population of 600 million , it accounts for 10 % of the world 's gdp , it is home to 40 % of the planet 's vegetable species and has a wealth of exceptional human resources .

we need long - term stability for the difficult , labour - intensive and costly  |||  activity  |||  of milk production .
mr president , commissioner , i have been searching in vain for an  |||  answer  |||  to the question of why we are debating a resolution on the summit with russia on the eve of the summit itself and voting on it on the day the summit takes place in nizhny novgorod .
when the british historian timothy garton ash , writing in thenew york review of books , distinguished the us and europe by paraphrasing the title of a bestselling book , saying that "  |||  americans  |||  are from mars , europeans are from venus , " some american readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate europe and a macho america .
two gue  |||  amendments  |||  were adopted ( equal access to healthcare / treatment and colombia ) .
tajikistan , however , is on something of a better path , and this agreement will  |||  allow  |||  the european union to have some influence on the situation there .
i am therefore certain that we will reach an  |||  agreement  |||  on the reserve .
since the  |||  agreement  |||  in lisbon there have been grounds for a certain optimism about the future of the european union , firstly with regard to the member states ' ability to agree ; secondly , there is a cautious attitude towards assessing the agreement achieved , since it will not be possible to evaluate the real effect of the treaty in that area until it has been in force for several years ; the third is a negative assessment of the fact that , following the outcome of the referendums in the netherlands and france , the constitutional treaty became a treaty partly by avoiding listening to public opinion .
will the commission now take  |||  action  |||  to make use of the results from the publicly - funded research and ensure that these chemicals with a high risk to human health can be dealt with as a priority under reach ?
although in november i asked the european commission a question regarding this issue and the  |||  answer  |||  was that new proposals intending roma integration would be launched , i hereby ask the commission to come up with clarifications on these intentions .
if we take the florenz report and say , ' this is the state of play in the climate policy debate in the european parliament ' , we might conclude that there is a wonderful ' climate '  |||  among  |||  members here in the european parliament , were it not for the fact that - like the beagle boys in the famous cartoons , whom we call the ' tank - busters ' in german - a very different agenda is being pursued in the same place at the same time !
at least 30 % of the heroin produced in  |||  afghanistan  |||  comes to europe and russia through tajikistan .
in summary , it is of vital importance that we concern ourselves with cultural and creative industries , which is why we must create as soon as possible - for artists and creative minds alike -  |||  adequate  |||  conditions that take into consideration unique characteristics , in the areas of mobility , intellectual property rights and social protection .
enhanced cooperation would facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market and would eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods , which would increase the number of inventors and would provide  |||  access  |||  to unitary patent protection throughout the eu .
besides , widespread revulsion against syria for its alleged role in the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , particularly  |||  among  |||  lebanon 's maronites , sunnis , and druze , means that lebanon is unlikely to ever become totally subservient again -- that is , unless hezbollah gets to call the shots .
finally , let me say something about the topic which also features at the top of the swedish presidency 's  |||  agenda  |||  , namely climate change , because we only have a few weeks to go to the copenhagen conference .
if the economic  |||  activities  |||  intensify over the coming years , then it will be important that we ensure a proper balance between the environment and economics and , in doing so , that we involve the local population .
the amount of the ecb 's " replacement lending " is shown by the so - called target2  |||  account  |||  , which measures the deficit or surplus of a country 's financial transactions with other countries .
since parliament and the council make decisions together with regard to objectives and content , and taking into account the fact that the council adopted its position on 10 december 2010 without , however , having taken into consideration parliament 's amendments relating to the procedures applicable to the adoption of programming documents and those relating to functioning , i  |||  agree  |||  that the position adopted by parliament at first reading should be restored in order to make sure that parliament is treated on an equal footing with the council / member states and that the programming structure of the industrialised countries instrument recognises the changes introduced by the treaty of lisbon .
but that would miss the most important point about  |||  america  |||  's role in the world : the same idealism that made kennedy so popular is also driving the decline in america 's international prestige .
the  |||  amendment  |||  tabled by mr fox attempted to combine the august and the september plenary sessions in one week .
this will  |||  allow  |||  croatia , if it is treated fairly , to complete the negotiations this year .
it has been the most successful development partner at fulfilling its commitments , notably in terms of market  |||  access  |||  , rules of origin and debt alleviation .

it is an undeniable fact that , until now , even with the stability and growth pact , even with a european central bank , the external representation of the eu in international financial bodies has fallen far short of the  |||  actual  |||  importance of economic and monetary union and what the european union project represents .
i am therefore pleased with the adoption of the 2010-2013 strategic  |||  action  |||  plan and with the partnerships established .
he made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is  |||  actually  |||  not the lack of legislation , but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market .

the rise of islamists throughout the region as the sole power capable of exploiting the opportunities of free elections -- hamas ' victory in palestine and the muslim brotherhood 's spectacular gains in the 2005 egyptian elections are but the most noteworthy -- the ascendancy to regional hegemony of shiite iran , and the sense among arab rulers that the embattled bush  |||  administration  |||  is running out of steam have all combined to stall the promising drive to political reform in the region .
( sk ) mr president , it is necessary to take  |||  account  |||  of many aspects when evaluating the report on the progress of iceland .

for example , one of my constituents , jeff stockdale from hull , a former fishermen , has invented a revolutionary pot trap that would encourage fish to enter it in order to escape from the tidal flow , but it would  |||  allow  |||  small fish to escape and larger ones to be released before being brought to the surface , if that should be necessary to avoid exceeding one 's quota .

one important weakness in the first energy efficiency national action plans , over and above the huge delay in submitting them on the part of certain member states , including greece , is the fact that the ambitious plans are not accompanied by clearly defined practical proposals with added value , despite the fact that , according to recent figures released by the european commission , if the target of achieving energy savings of 20 % were  |||  achieved  |||  , the eu would use approximately 400 mtoe less primary energy and co2 emissions would fall by 860 mt.

to my mind , the question is this : why do we find it so easy to  |||  agree  |||  on instruments for adaptation and yet so difficult to agree on ways of actually combating global warming ?
one final reservation i should like to mention is the failure to take  |||  account  |||  of the special circumstances of forest protection .

based on my notes on what has been said by representatives of individual parliamentary groups , it is not at all my view that our agenda is too liberal or too conservative ; our agenda arises from the long - term aims and long - term  |||  agenda  |||  of the european union , and the czech contribution to it , the czech imprint , showed itself in the very first days of the new year as being well - conceived , because our emphasis on energy security may lead us , unexpectedly and none too soon , into some very thorough , in - depth discussion on how to ensure the independence and freedom of the european union , which presupposes independence or less dependence on energy imports and sources outside the european union .

tomorrow , in my opinion , the european council must take a clear decision on a new strategy - the heads of state and government can do so - a new strategy whereby those wishing to remain on board may remain on board , but europe has to move  |||  ahead  |||  in the general interest .
ending the  |||  american  |||  occupation in iraq and imposing an arab - israeli peace would help , but they are no panacea .
this may seem like a large  |||  amount  |||  of funding , but in fact , it is very little .
but the biggest difficulty in using big data to build a better society is being able to develop a human - scale , intuitive understanding of social physics .  |||  although  |||  dense , continuous data and modern computation allow us to map many details about society , and to explain how communities might work , such raw mathematical models contain too many variables and complex relationships for most people to understand .
this development , which has serious consequences , represents a two - pronged challenge , namely , managing more than 1 200 bilateral investment treaties ( bits ) and defining a european policy for future investment that meets the expectations of investors and beneficiary states , while also respecting the eu 's external  |||  action  |||  objectives .
why it is necessary for the council to constantly make those cuts is a mystery to me , as we have been holding discussions based on that commission letter of  |||  amendment  |||  since as far back as the treaty of amsterdam , as it provides us with the most recent figures available .
in conclusion , i am happy to support this framework  |||  agreement  |||  because i know that in the sixth framework programme , developments in science and research were already being integrated very actively and with genuinely good results .
in writing . - ( it ) the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 1334/2000 setting up a community regime for the control mechanism of exports of dual - use items and technology , as tabled on 7 february 2011 ,  |||  aims  |||  to supply the union with an efficient regime of preventive measures designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons , including weapons of mass destruction .
the resolution  |||  adopted  |||  by the committee on regional development proposes the creation , as from the forthcoming post - 2013 programming period , of a single strategic framework to ensure a common approach and to capitalise on synergies between all actions which serve to further cohesion policy objectives as defined by the treaties and funded by the erdf , the cohesion fund , the european social fund ( esf ) , the european agricultural fund for rural development ( eafrd ) and the european fisheries fund ( eff ) .
in those six months , we were also able to obtain agreements on the management of speculative funds and other  |||  alternative  |||  investment funds as well as on the rating agencies .
by adopting the joint eu - armenia enp  |||  action  |||  plan in 2006 , we acquired a policy tool for promoting the observance of principles based on our shared values .
this will  |||  allow  |||  a future mediterranean economic area with the new democracies in the south , and i hope that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have marked the work on this subject will lead to the permanent involvement of parliament in planning and evaluating this policy .
the zaleski report has its basis in a commission proposal whose aim is only to renew some of the cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  with ukraine following the country 's accession to the wto .
this intergovernmental approach lay behind the lisbon  |||  agenda  |||  's failure to deliver the results needed to make europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010 , and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor , the new " europe 2020 " strategy .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin first by thanking parliament for  |||  allowing  |||  me at this key moment to address this sitting with a matter as unquestionably sensitive as the economic partnership agreements .
i have been in rome and i must say that apart from the final declaration which is , i must  |||  agree  |||  , a little bit disappointing , there have been very good discussions and also a very good presence , and something can come out of it .
|||  another  |||  issue voiced by the citizens that merits our attention concerns the deadline for calls for submissions of projects for financing under the european social fund .
european  |||  action  |||  has been joint action .
ever since george w. bush took office , america 's  |||  annual  |||  real gdp growth has averaged 2.3 % -- a pace that would have been acclaimed as normal and satisfactory when george w. bush 's father or ronald reagan was president , but that after the clinton boom now seems tawdry and sluggish .
madam president , i consider that an anti - drug plan in  |||  afghanistan  |||  , consisting in the control of opium quantities by using them to obtain analgesics and other derivatives , might represent one and not the only alternative economic solution and a means of reducing poppy cultivation .
we have a broad  |||  agenda  |||  that will feature progress in many areas .
i would like to highlight the main directions in the fight against poverty  |||  among  |||  women : combating poverty among women by means of employment policy and social protection ; the importance of social dialogue and civil society in combating poverty among women ; the importance of financial aid in combating poverty .
these two traits ,  |||  although  |||  they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of american and british conservatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that germany now requires .
so there is no clarity on this issue but , once  |||  again  |||  , the problem for the european parliament , for the eu in general , is that there is no consistency across member states , and yet our citizens are accessing services outside their own country , and they want to do that .
when  |||  adopted  |||  , the programme will enable them to accomplish their mission in a more independent and more efficient manner .
obama has called for  |||  additional  |||  united states and nato troops to stabilize the situation , but too many foreign troops will only increase afghan nationalist reactions .
here in the us , it might seem like an image of our future , as public debt comes perilously close to 100 % of  |||  annual  |||  gdp and continues to rise .
attention should also be drawn to the fact that this new agreement has opened the way to opportunities in terms of  |||  additional  |||  investment and market access as well as strengthening cooperation in regulatory areas such as safety , security and the environment , where both sides agreed a dedicated joint statement on the environment .
i should like to thank mr moraes for his excellent work and i share with him the idea of adopting a constructive approach that includes most of the amendments proposed by the commission , as well as numerous technical amendments  |||  agreed  |||  in the council during negotiations on this instrument .
on the other hand , i think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international  |||  agenda  |||  and that , whenever world leaders meet , for example , latterly in pittsburgh for the g20 , there is talk of development cooperation and development policy .
in  |||  addition  |||  to the identically tailored imf - eu programmes that they want to implement in ireland and now portugal , they are preparing to reinforce the attack on greece , squeezing its people even further .
during those two decades , your  |||  annual  |||  average return would have been more than 16 % .
the voting list also has  |||  amendment  |||  8 replaced with amendment 14 .
on the subject of sovereign debt , i advocated that the rating agencies should avoid pro - cyclicality in their work and take into  |||  account  |||  the forecasts of the main international financial institutions .
i can assure you that it is the commission 's utmost  |||  ambition  |||  to deliver on this very important strategy .
we would remind the house that the chadian authorities must approve the minurcat operating procedures as soon as possible because any additional delays could obviously  |||  affect  |||  the deployment schedule for the chad humanitarian protection police force , more than half of the budget for which is financed by the commission .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur that the two are closely linked .
moreover , the problems relating to the eu - mercosur association  |||  agreement  |||  are not adequately resolved in the report .
given this clearly unacceptable situation , particularly in comparison with other types of bus , what steps is the commission taking to ensure that there are  |||  adequate  |||  safety measures for the operation of ' bendy buses ' and that drivers receive the necessary level of training ?
i believe you will  |||  agree  |||  that that is perversion .
because of lousy salaries in the state  |||  administration  |||  , many young and gifted people avoid government service , preferring to look for better - paid jobs in the private sector , or to emigrate .
with this in mind we agree with the idea that union vessels that operate in deep - sea areas that are not subject to any regional fisheries organisation or  |||  agreement  |||  should be subject to community regulations governing the conditions that they must fulfil in order to obtain the relevant special permits at these depths , and specifying the subsequent conduct that they must observe , the information they must provide , etc.
let us not forget that , in certain member states , there is no single centre for forensic study but rather several , taking into  |||  account  |||  the distribution of territories and existing police and legal systems .
the commission could partially  |||  accept  |||  the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling .
|||  although  |||  , undoubtedly , the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems , it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries , from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness , and from the absence of coordination in european economic policy .
but i abstained on the final vote on the instrument ( dci ) itself as , directly or indirectly , the  |||  african  |||  peace facility was funded through this instrument , and this funding was used inter alia for police and army training missions .
i hope that after the compromise  |||  among  |||  the political parties represented in this chamber , we will have a good first reading agreement from the council and within a few years , perhaps , i will be able to quote here in this chamber the useful data from the latest european pesticides statistics .
small purchases at current panic prices , vulture - fund style , are  |||  always  |||  possible , but they do not promise substantial debt relief .
we want a global  |||  agreement  |||  , but that naturally requires the involvement of all the major players : china , india and above all the us .
i agree with you that the priority is safety , and that the crisis that has  |||  affected  |||  us is a complicated one , but we took too long to communicate , because we did so five days after the first attempt .
it is worth remembering that the uprising in tunisia which set off the domino effect  |||  across  |||  the entire middle east began with the self - immolation of a poor street food trader .
i therefore ask you to support mr mulder 's amendment 31 proposing a threshold of eur 100 , a compromise i feel could be  |||  acceptable  |||  to all .
the recent humanitarian disasters in haiti and pakistan demonstrated once  |||  again  |||  that the eu 's disaster - response capability needs to be greatly enhanced .
all older children or  |||  adults  |||  are charged myr 69.00 per night and person for extra beds .
here the major challenge will be for the ccp to  |||  accept  |||  that wto membership presumes that disputes will be resolved by an independent , rules - based , supra - national body rather than by party - fiat or through the mediation of local political connections .
it is time for tangible  |||  action  |||  .
i have  |||  always  |||  asked why those studies disappeared , but the truth is that it was worrying , so they have told us time and time again .
i hope that we can definitely achieve the goals you mentioned in your question with this  |||  amount  |||  of money .
unfortunately , this coexistence has not  |||  always  |||  been peaceful .
however , i believe that we should adopt more general systems of social security , which would apply both to open - ended contracts and to part - time employment : in short , the intention is that these forms of employment should also be provided with  |||  adequate  |||  social security cover , not that open - ended contracts should be weakened .
we are hoping that the new  |||  action  |||  plan just announced by the commissioner will be implemented as soon as possible in order to improve existing mechanisms by extending technical and human support , guaranteeing financial support and increasing planned budgetary resources .
while the major problems caused by a bankrupt economic system can be resolved through  |||  adequate  |||  measures , human beings need time to forget , forgive and adapt to a new way of life , even if it is incomparably better .
we have made a preliminary  |||  analysis  |||  of energy efficiency action plans , which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts .
to function and remain socially  |||  acceptable  |||  , however , capitalism must be as clean as possible .
but doubling us foreign aid involves a modest  |||  amount  |||  of money , compared to what will be saved by pulling out of iraq .
i also strongly support the appeal made by guido sacconi , the committee 's chairman , that the post - election parliament should  |||  address  |||  this issue and ensure that there is the most robust approach here to issues concerning climate change .
to conclude , the aim of the reforms requested by the european union is not only to enable this country to form closer links with the european union but ,  |||  above  |||  all , to ensure that its entire population benefits from the progress that we are trying to encourage .
what about the unlawful  |||  actions  |||  against romanians in rome ?
·sri mulyani indrawati is  |||  another  |||  highly qualified candidate from southeast asia .
mr president , one parliamentary priority is also to  |||  address  |||  an alarming situation where the human rights council 's activities have resulted in extreme politicisation .
obviously if the implementing agreements later bring to light things that are not  |||  acceptable  |||  from the point of view of community law , we shall see what needs to be done , but we shall do something .
i believe that it is the european union 's duty to promote good quality products , along with taking  |||  action  |||  to protect them globally .
the report also  |||  adds  |||  value to the current debate concerning the possible ways forward in this regard .
but even if the fed does not admit it in its forecasts , the price of this " insurance policy " will  |||  almost  |||  certainly be higher inflation down the road , and perhaps for several years .
debate over iraq dominated international diplomacy , and took up  |||  almost  |||  the entire un agenda .
the  |||  answer  |||  is making your own depend ( ) function in /etc/conf.d/net.
on behalf of the efd group . - mr president , following the report by the honourable member , mrs guy - quint , dated april 2008 , the new legal framework  |||  affecting  |||  budgetary matters should now be ready for adoption .
fifteen years ago in my book the end of history and the last man i argued that , if a society wanted to be modern , there was no  |||  alternative  |||  to a market economy and a democratic political system .
rapidshare free premium  |||  account  |||  from rvsdi.com is one form of thanks to loyal visitors and visitors who stray from the search engine - with the keyword " rapidshare premium account " - which has opened a blog rvsdi.com .
at the same time , women from disadvantaged backgrounds must be guaranteed equal  |||  access  |||  to public health systems , as well as gynaecological and obstetric care , and to decent housing , justice , sports and culture .
the current protocol to the fisheries partnership  |||  agreement  |||  ( fpa ) with the islamic republic of mauritania expires on 31 july 2012 , and the commission intends to launch negotiations regarding its renewal , for which it has received a prescriptive mandate from the council .
this subject comes under its competence and , sadly , i cannot give a meaningful  |||  answer  |||  .
the few  |||  african  |||  countries that already have such institutions in place -- among them south africa , kenya , nigeria , ghana , zambia , and senegal -- are clearly moving in the right direction .
madam president , please  |||  allow  |||  me to begin by recounting a story .
in principle , the signature of the horizontal  |||  agreement  |||  at the summit should be accompanied by the signature of the financing agreement on a new civil aviation cooperation programme covering eur 12.5 million .
it will also be vital to conduct an information campaign  |||  aimed  |||  at making citizens aware of the possibility of issuing a european protection order .
had  |||  american  |||  forces not expelled the british from us territory in the first , and had abraham lincoln and the union not prevailed in the second , the country would have been balkanized and unable to become the dominant power of the twentieth century .
the first reforms to  |||  afghanistan  |||  's army will only make these divisions worse .
the fact that the organisers of last year 's flotilla are planning to repeat their  |||  action  |||  on the anniversary of the incident and meps from the gue and greens / efa political groups organised a hearing at the ep on 10 may put the issue yet again in the spotlight .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  with the target of 147 g of co2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the eu , if it is confirmed that this option is viable .
mr president , we are debating a dossier today which has put on our  |||  agenda  |||  in recent months a number of issues of principle .
high unemployment , particularly  |||  among  |||  young people , locks roma in a vicious cycle of impoverishment and exclusion , further driving down living standards and leaving many in marginalized settlements without access to electricity , clean water , or other basic utilities .
if we find that some of the  |||  alternatives  |||  are no less dangerous , then i am sure the commissioner or his successors will be back to tell us so and to bring forward a proposal - and if they do not i am sure carl schlyter will .
because of the sponsorship  |||  agreement  |||  was finalized just days before the first world cup jumping , remained for the rather expensive airbrush painting , designed by stiegl - house graphic designer hannes eder , implementing only two days .
thus , in order to keep the current -  |||  account  |||  deficit stable , the trade deficit must shrink .
|||  according  |||  to the case law of the court of justice , any restriction on such recognition must not give rise to discrimination , must be reasoned and must be proportionate .
unfortunately , the latest political incident involving the democracy - promoting activities of  |||  american  |||  ngos has cooled bilateral relations and threatens the $ 1.3 billion in military assistance that egypt receives annually from the united states .
the average import price for the us in the period 2005-2007 was eur 12.45 per kilogram ; for the first quarter of 2008 the price  |||  actually  |||  rose slightly to eur 13.6 per kilogram .
i  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur that we should apply the cooperation specific programme which identifies fuel cells and hydrogen as one of the six areas where a jti could have particular relevance .
the substance of the report  |||  actually  |||  takes care of all the criticism that has been presented .
regarding transparency , i expect a balance to be achieved when establishing the european external  |||  action  |||  service .
last month , on 24 june , china also took a positive step by reopening  |||  access  |||  for foreign tourists to tibet .
i voted in favour of the conclusion of the new  |||  agreement  |||  between the european union and the united states of america on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of the terrorist finance tracking program , because i felt that the new proposal tabled by the commission offered eu citizens increased assurances , in particular as regards data protection .
while this process will generate a significant amount of value -- more than $ 5 trillion in 2025 ,  |||  according  |||  to mgi estimates -- it will not be distributed evenly among workers , leaving many to confront the need to retrain for new jobs .
in more immediate terms , i call on the commission to authorise a oneoff increase in cofinancing via the erdf and esf regional funds for projects in the regions  |||  affected  |||  , within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer .
this new strategic approach to culture sets common objectives and  |||  aims  |||  to propel the economic , social and political value of culture by strengthening its transversal role .
similarly , the effect of human  |||  activities  |||  , considered even by this report to be the main cause for climate change , is also questioned by some scientists .
in writing . - ( lt ) we must combat tuberculosis , because this disease kills nearly two million people worldwide each year , and  |||  almost  |||  a third of the world 's population is infected by it .
|||  although  |||  i would prefer not to see casinos going up anywhere in the european union , i still consider this the least bad solution .
we would not want to waste all the work done and the positive things achieved , including , for example , the contribution of our  |||  amendment  |||  on the right of recourse , which is intended to bring about a clear improvement in the activity of small traders without harming consumer rights .
in some states in europe it is still not illegal , and would the commission encourage member states to  |||  adopt  |||  a common position on dealing with this very difficult issue ?
it is also proposed that we should have a common support service to help the small  |||  agencies  |||  with burdensome administrative tasks .
they did not make arrangements for passengers to have  |||  access  |||  to free telephone , fax , e-mail or internet facilities , and did not provide transfer or accommodation , either , even though passengers are entitled to such support under the eu regulations in force .
|||  among  |||  other things , we would like to see a reduction in the proportion of the eu budget allocated to agricultural policy , the retention and development of cross - compliance and the adaptation of the system to the market .
|||  among  |||  other things , it will be vital to refocus the priorities of the framework research programme , so as to enable adequate coverage of this important area of research .
is it not , after all , the case that standardising the time all  |||  across  |||  europe to one time zone would be beneficial just from the transport perspective ?
first , we must complete economic and monetary union by creating a european stability  |||  agency  |||  for common eurobonds and i am glad that president barroso did not rule out the idea of eurobonds today .
as i have mentioned on many previous occasions , i firmly believe that the failure to reach agreement on the  |||  amendment  |||  is a bad message for european workers and enterprises , for european institutions and , by extension , for europe as a whole .
we cannot solve the issues surrounding the  |||  accessibility  |||  of food by violating food safety requirements and putting people 's health at risk .
without knowing all possible  |||  alternatives  |||  , we cannot form a limited , testable set of clear hypotheses .
this plan includes concrete measures for supporting small and medium - sized enterprises , the most important of which are the measures aimed at improving  |||  access  |||  to finance and reducing the administrative burden on business .
|||  america  |||  , by contrast , seems to have an abundance of all the things europe lacks .
president - in - office of the council . - ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , and mr president , you will understand that , before i refer specifically to the item on the  |||  agenda  |||  which brought me here today , i should like , on behalf of the portuguese government and the portuguese presidency of the council , to thank you for such a warm and friendly tribute - so well deserved in my opinion - which you paid upon the such unexpected and sad loss of my fellow countryman and member of this parliament , dr fausto correia .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  that surveillance of the economic policies of the member states should be broadened beyond budgetary surveillance to prevent excessive macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities within the union .
in writing . - i am opposed to extremism in any form , but i do not accept that the british people must take  |||  advice  |||  from the eu on this - or indeed on any other matter .
i fear that the application of this directive at a regional and local level could work against deregulation measures and impede attempts to simplify administrative procedures , especially as its application may involve  |||  additional  |||  resources , the contribution of structural funds and other instruments being essential to make up for this during the transition period .
|||  american  |||  leaders will welcome her election as proof that the estrangement in bilateral relations is over .
there is an  |||  alternative  |||  to spending so much to achieve so little .
|||  across  |||  africa , these approaches often aim for a " win_win " outcome : the poor benefit and resources are conserved .
it is also my earnest wish to see montenegro finally create the national  |||  agency  |||  that will let the country enable its students and trainees to take part in the erasmus and leonardo education programmes .
however , as a result of human  |||  activity  |||  , the process of biodiversity loss around the world is advancing with increasing speed .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the third package of measures for the internal energy market must be coordinated with the copenhagen agreement in order to achieve energy security , promote renewable energy , and capture and store carbon dioxide .
the institutions ' transparency and the clarity of their representatives '  |||  actions  |||  should be an intrinsic element of real and genuine democracy .
see the offer of the locations for shooting that can be rented for taking a movie of shooting fashion or  |||  advertising  |||  photos .
i do not mind another view ,  |||  another  |||  attitude , as long as it does not lay claim to me , as long as i am not attacked for thinking differently .
we cannot , however , view the association  |||  agreement  |||  from a purely economic perspective ; the importance of the political dimension of the agreement needs to be stressed .
do you not need to  |||  address  |||  the problem of climate change denial if you are to raise our ambitions ?
politically , no european country can - or really wants to - adopt the  |||  american  |||  model .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing discharge of the 2008 budget , but discharge is always an opportunity to look  |||  ahead  |||  and i feel that in this context in particular , we must focus on the many agencies that we have introduced .
if a mass  |||  accident  |||  occurs due to the reckless and risky management practices of the company in charge , the legal entity can rightly be held accountable .
however , it is lacking one critical and ,  |||  above  |||  all , self - critical analysis .
as i understand they are especially interested in the commission and the international organisations that are providing them with help giving them sme market access so that they can  |||  actually  |||  make use of the access to the european market .
i therefore cannot  |||  accept  |||  that nabucco will pose a challenge to projects such as south stream and , to some extent , nord stream , whose aim is to supply gas directly from russia to a european union member state , thereby ensuring that the european union is not dependent on transit supplies through countries which are both politically and economically unstable .
in these areas ,  |||  afghanistan  |||  and pakistan will need our support for a very , very long time to come .
at the copenhagen session of the climate change conference at the end of 2009 , europe should be the leading force in negotiations on ambitious and comprehensive  |||  agreement  |||  for the post - kyoto period . this is one more reason to adopt the agreement as soon as possible in 2009 .
|||  although  |||  i feel that some of you are a little pessimistic about the progress that has been made , i want to approach this from a more positive side .
i would like to stress that , in my view , the biggest challenge facing the european union is  |||  actually  |||  the sense of solidarity between europeans from the old countries and new countries , in other words , the solidarity between europeans from east and west .
we should remember that this initiative is part of a package which  |||  aims  |||  to stimulate failing european economies .
in particular the commission should provide greater visibility over projects financed by the european union for reconstruction in iraq in 2006 ; for example , it should list the projects , what they are , the anticipated costs , and the  |||  agencies  |||  involved .
on 14 june 2010 , the commission published its  |||  action  |||  plan on global navigation satellite systems ( gnss ) , which included 24 specific recommendations for action .
the levels and differences of consumer prices between the member states are also monitored in the  |||  annual  |||  report of the consumer markets scoreboard .
literary researchers today may consider themselves to be the subject of literary history , and feel responsible only for their own reputation  |||  among  |||  other researchers ; but let us try to admit that the ultimate point of thinking about history is to help form the memory of a supra - individual collective known as the nation .
that will allow member states -  |||  allow  |||  , not oblige - to include external environment costs in tolls if they wish , and not just infrastructure costs , as is the case currently .
when we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble  |||  ahead  |||  .
health results cannot be  |||  achieved  |||  without adequate investment in the systems that deliver better health .
you do have a chance , however , for  |||  another  |||  30 seconds if you agree to answer a blue card question by mr van dalen .
i am voting for this partnership and cooperation agreement establishing a partnership between the european communities and their member states , of the one part , and ukraine , of the other part , on the general principles for the participation of ukraine in union programmes , and i welcome it because it is  |||  another  |||  step in pursuing the objectives that guided the creation of the common market .
otherwise , we would vote against all the  |||  amendments  |||  put forward .
in 2007  |||  alone  |||  , 75 ats laboratories were seized in china .
the  |||  administration  |||  did launch a modest regulatory - reform initiative in summer 2009 , proposing new consumer protections and some measures to strengthen financial stability , but the measures were fought every inch of the way . and early in 2010 a new bank tax was proposed that aimed to raise about $ 90 billion over a decade or so -- but that would have represented only about 1 % of banks ' profits .
food scandals occur time and  |||  again  |||  and not even the new legislation will prevent this , as no european rules are designed to prevent criminal activity ; but these rules will help ensure that , when these scandals do occur , it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in .
we express our solidarity with the people of burma and demand that the arrested protesters be released immediately and that http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991 be  |||  allowed  |||  to live a rewarding life and have freedom of action .
i also regret the stance of certain fellow members who , knowing in advance that a particular proposal would not be  |||  adopted  |||  , placed the burden of doing something ' politically incorrect ' on others , and still others who ' preferred ' not to participate in voting on the three amendments in question , despite participating in all the voting before and after them .
all older children or  |||  adults  |||  are charged nok 190.00 per night and person for extra beds .
this will change after the new legislation is implemented , which will  |||  allow  |||  special services to interfere in the activities of the media , close down editorial sections and control the printed or spoken word .
subject : eu earthquake policy :  |||  actions  |||  taken by the commission in the wake of the recent catastrophic earthquake in italy
|||  although  |||  the directive will apply to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes , i think that this provision goes too far , because such vehicles mainly operate regionally , and this should not be regulated at european level .
i congratulate him on these  |||  amendments  |||  and i sincerely hope that the commission will change its opinion and that it will pay greater attention to what our rapporteur has said .
we all share the goal of a more open , transparent china adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to  |||  address  |||  global challenges .
but a $ 3 billion investment by the chinese swf in the us investment firm blackstone suggests a more worryingly strategic investment policy , one that appears  |||  aimed  |||  at advancing its own industrial interests in certain markets .
in order to improve  |||  access  |||  to financial resources for poorer groups in the eligible countries , an additional grant of eur 500 million should be allocated to the eib immediately to finance micro - credits .

as the content of the renewed agreement will be identical to the content of the  |||  agreement  |||  which expires on 20 february 2009 , there would be no sense in continuing talks on the renewal of this agreement in the usual manner .

it is unfortunate that during the many months -  |||  almost  |||  one year - that have passed since the first discussion of the dossier in committee , interinstitutional negotiations have not made any progress .

i do not like bullfighting or cockfighting either but these are , believe it or not ,  |||  allowed  |||  in some parts of the eu on the grounds of national culture , so if iceland joins the eu , it must be allowed - in my personal view - to safeguard its whaling industry if it insists on so doing .

whilst i wholeheartedly agree that rising energy prices require affirmative political  |||  action  |||  , i reject the resolution 's references to ' low carbon ' energy . i reject the idea that increased nuclear energy can have a positive impact on the environment and believe that political attention should be focused on non - nuclear renewable energy sources .
true , there were differences  |||  among  |||  countries , but most observers regarded them as less important relative to the common challenges .
the hotel enjoys good  |||  access  |||  to the motorway network , just 1.2 km away , and is also very central ( 1.2 km from the city centre ) .
of the advocated measures , i would stress : effective and flexible meat - market mechanisms ; combating speculation on cereals and the creation of a safety net in this sector ;  |||  adequate  |||  protection of farm workers in the most disadvantaged areas , and greater power for producer organisations .
competition  |||  among  |||  nations and among peoples trumps cooperation , and regional and global conflicts obstruct the pathways to a sustainable future .
this represents a welcome development at a time when the irish government has introduced a new  |||  airport  |||  tax which will discriminate against beleaguered smaller regional airports to the advantage of the already congested dublin airport .
it therefore contains a horizontal social clause which states that the promotion of a high level of employment ,  |||  adequate  |||  social protection and the fight against exclusion must guide the definition and implementation of all eu policies .
we are now in the third year following the financial crisis and i am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package - that would , of course , be an  |||  additional  |||  measure - or whether we have to expect that , by the weekend , yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others .
" this is the future of search engines  |||  according  |||  to one of the leading experts on search engines that italy and europe know .
we need to seek allies  |||  among  |||  those with whom we share common values and common interests , and not among those who are very far from us .
in  |||  addition  |||  , nuclear energy reduces a country 's dependency on the supply of fuel from unstable territories .
first , the european parliament must take into  |||  account  |||  the real economic situation in the member states - the fact that , in most states of the european union , the economy is either declining or stagnating , and that in only a few countries is it growing .
in any case , in order to have an appropriate structure to the text , i would like to table the following oral amendment , in agreement with the shadow rapporteurs . amendments 1 , 3 and 4 are to be moved after paragraph 32 , amendment 5 after recital m , and  |||  amendment  |||  6 after recital q. this is just the replacement of that .
in this regard , i thank the rapporteur for including in the compromise  |||  amendments  |||  requests relating to the particular challenges facing the outermost regions in terms of accessibility and competitiveness , which are vital aspects of territorial cohesion .
|||  additional  |||  environmental criteria are simply not included .
moreover , for the future discharge procedures , the director of each eu  |||  agency  |||  should make available to parliament its report from the internal audit service .
it should also be highlighted that the ' package ' will facilitate  |||  access  |||  for people with disabilities to telecommunications services .
the rhetoric from the fund has been ambitious , including at the recently concluded  |||  annual  |||  meeting of its shareholders -- the world 's central banks and finance ministries -- in washington .
i believe that the government of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has made significant progress in 2009 , as is also highlighted in the resolution on the 2009  |||  activity  |||  report .
as part of the reform of the common agricultural policy , we should focus ,  |||  among  |||  other things , on preventing monocultures and increasing the use of wide crop rotation .
i understand that the rapporteur agrees with this oral  |||  amendment  |||  .
the commission is currently implementing a preparatory  |||  action  |||  in the field of sport in order to prepare future eu actions in accordance with the budgetary decisions taken by parliament , and the 2009 preparatory action has already provided a clear indication about the high interest in the area of hepa , with 64 % of the applications for the action being in this area .
the economic crash in the united kingdom is at least as severe as in  |||  america  |||  , forcing the government to rely almost entirely on deficit spending to prevent a complete meltdown of its financial system .
we can only encourage them to do this under the terms of the treaty , which have never been revised and which are useful terms  |||  allowing  |||  europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement .
obviously we can talk here about monitoring , about controls on imports from china , but let us not forget something known as re - export , which is where china sends certain items to , for example , african countries , and those items then come to us as african products ,  |||  although  |||  really they are products made in chinese factories located in those countries , or actually manufactured in china .
olmert , defense minister ehud barak , and foreign minister tzippi livni have cast aside their political rivalries in order to orchestrate an  |||  answer  |||  : israel must fight off the gazan rockets .
i welcome the fact that the report deals with the unfair treatment of prisoners in the  |||  american  |||  detention facility at guantánamo .
in addition , since the total number of cattle herds and sheep flocks  |||  affected  |||  by the disease increased from 695 in 2006 to 6 857 in 2007 in belgium alone , would the commission state what measures it intends to introduce for the development of an antiviral treatment , for vaccination campaigns , and for the financing of the foregoing ?
however , its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into  |||  account  |||  a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country .
the presidency confirms that the council does in fact carry out a six - monthly review of the situation as regards implementation of the eu counter - terrorism strategy and of the strategy against terrorist financing and an  |||  annual  |||  evaluation of the implementation of the strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism .
we also need to emphasise the possibility of a fast - track procedure , which reduces the time needed for  |||  administration  |||  , and it is also important that veterinarians thus have much more rapid access to the medicinal products .
while the increase in revenue is largely due to the vat and gni balances , budgetary under - implementation is mainly responsible for the significant reduction in expenditure , with the cuts essentially  |||  affecting  |||  the headings of cohesion , fisheries , environment and agriculture .
in  |||  addition  |||  , there is supervision of maintenance .
therefore , i am in favour of the debate going ahead , albeit voicing my regret once  |||  again  |||  that the council is absent .
thus , the election results should not be viewed primarily as an endorsement of the republicans , but as a rebuke to the democrats '  |||  agenda  |||  , which voters believed was out of touch with their concerns , interests , and values .
thirdly , i  |||  agree  |||  with the commissions proposal to use mixtures of natural gas and hydrogen , but only as a transition fuel and only in countries that have a well - developed natural gas infrastructure .
given that , in the already extensive relations between the eu and the principality of andorra , this is another positive step towards possible integration into the internal market and that , as well as including rules to ensure that the  |||  agreement  |||  and the eu acquis remain in alignment , it aims to ensure customs security and normal relations between both parties , i welcome the adoption of this recommendation , for which i voted .
promoting the flexibility and security model gives employers a strong weapon with which to increase temporary  |||  agency  |||  work , which results in less favourable working conditions and waters down collective agreements .
he was an apologist for  |||  american  |||  power , even though during the vietnam years he had wriggled and dodged to avoid being at the sharp , conscripted end of it .
the presidency is also aware of the widely - shared consensus among the member states that short - , medium - and long - term solutions be  |||  adopted  |||  without delay that would prevent similar situations from recurring in the future .
thank you , commissioner , for your  |||  answer  |||  .
the delay in carrying out a number of  |||  activities  |||  calls into question the principle of budgetary annuality , which has caused the carryover of budgetary appropriations .
we support  |||  action  |||  against undeclared work , but we have to abstain from voting because this proposal has serious shortcomings .
at the end of 2008 ,  |||  almost  |||  17 % of the european population - that is , 85 million people - were living below the poverty line .
from now on ,  |||  alternative  |||  investment funds ( hedge funds ) entering europe will be more strictly monitored and regulated by europe .

|||  americans  |||  are from italy , europeans are from japan
this proposal does not alter the content of the codified legal acts ; it only joins these  |||  acts  |||  together , following the necessary amendments for codification .
entrepreneurship , training , flexibility , smart regulation and  |||  access  |||  to credit are the key words of the small business act , a framework that defines the eu policy for smes through targeted assistance and training activities for young people .
commissioner , we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises , written texts which are extremely interesting and with which i  |||  agree  |||  almost 100 % .
it is not just about those who are facing conviction and the death penalty but , along with them , all the many others that are  |||  affected  |||  , their families and so many other people in society , simply because those people face execution without any opportunity of a fair trial .
there is another element which is essential for the consistency of the exercise : the use of common definitions for the capital thresholds  |||  according  |||  to which the participating banks will be assessed .
the debate on the transfer of passenger name records and the difficulty with the pnr  |||  agreement  |||  and its legal basis have been enough to show us that there is simply no such thing as balanced negotiations on these issues .
( the speaker  |||  agreed  |||  to take a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
the aim of the new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the partnership  |||  agreement  |||  in the fisheries sector between the european community and the union of the comoros is to strengthen the partnership and cooperation in the fisheries sector using all the available financial instruments .
in  |||  addition  |||  , tracing firearms is of the greatest importance in the fight against organised crime .
to conclude , the awareness campaign on the importance of this year and cultural dialogue encompasses in itself a vast range of  |||  activities  |||  aimed at young people , based on proposals by civil associations and eu initiatives .
i realise that it is difficult for the commissioner to reach true  |||  agreement  |||  on this under the unanimity rule .
for that reason , the commission needs to provide information as to the  |||  actual  |||  costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts , and i do not think that the refusal that i have just heard from the commission is acceptable .
does this negotiating mandate also provide for a general  |||  agreement  |||  on personal data protection ?
meps have therefore called for universal  |||  access  |||  to affordable healthcare to be improved .
( cs ) madam president , in the debate on the ce marking yesterday i drew the attention of the commission yet  |||  again  |||  to the fact that registration of the ce marking has still not been initiated , although it has been enshrined in european legislation for 16 years now and i asked for it in parliamentary interpellation three months ago .
it is futile for the bush  |||  administration  |||  to deny it .
against this background , the commission remains confident that the european union aid levels will increase  |||  again  |||  as of 2008 - this year .
i would like to appeal strongly here to mrs malmström to ensure that coordination between member states on security will be equally as good as it has been until now , and once  |||  again  |||  , i would like to thank mr coelho very much for a splendid report .
|||  another  |||  issue raised once again is the easy option : blame the cap - as if the cap were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world .
to name but one : after a re - examination of procurement by the european network and information security  |||  agency  |||  more weaknesses were found in this area .
it was , as we all remember , a very serious railway  |||  accident  |||  .
europe must take collective  |||  action  |||  to overcome the current situation .
let us look at  |||  actions  |||  , not words .
we must make sure that we play our part in the eu ensuring that the hungry  |||  across  |||  the world are fed .
moreover , the automakers are essential for closing the trade deficit , and their demise could bring  |||  another  |||  surge in imports .
the imf and world bank would offer  |||  advice  |||  , expertise , and financing , with the fund concentrating on the macroeconomic and financial stability that is crucial to fostering durable growth and poverty reduction .
if we now start cutting corners to the detriment of social services , education and training and ,  |||  above  |||  all , child care , then that will have implications for the future and for the livelihoods of women .
this hotel is just 50 metres away from nuremberg  |||  airport  |||  and 20 metres from the underground station taking guests into nuremberg city centre in only 12 minutes .
( bg ) first of all , mr strasser , i would like to say that i cannot  |||  agree  |||  that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used .
the licensing procedure via the food safety authority is excellent , but what bothers me - and here i should like to ask the commission to have a rethink - is that we are giving the food safety authority nine months for authorisation or risk  |||  analysis  |||  .
while i believe this technology might help industry to reduce co2 emissions , i cannot  |||  accept  |||  that european taxpayers ' money be used to finance the development of a ccs infrastructure that will be someone 's business in the end .
it underscored , however , that their recovery was still somewhat fragile and called on the committee of european banking supervisors to provide regular information on the  |||  amount  |||  of capital available for additional borrowing .
i absolutely  |||  agree  |||  with the points that have been made in respect of the national standards institutes .
it must be possible to  |||  allow  |||  a bank to fail whilst still protecting customers .
in writing . - i supported the compromise package and rejected those  |||  amendments  |||  seeking to extend the transitional period for the " repair clause " .
the fact that turkmenistan borders  |||  afghanistan  |||  makes it also a strategically important country .
it is only by making a joint effort that we will be able to  |||  address  |||  the social and health consequences of dementia and provide services and support for people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases , as well as for their families .
can you witness , with a clear conscience , the staggering increase in unemployment figures which have now reached millions in the european union , and the shameless rewards  |||  again  |||  being paid out by the financial sector to those who have not only plunged us into the worst crisis imaginable , but also threatened us with poverty ?
speaking of social policy , which has been mentioned here on many occasions , i  |||  agree  |||  : yes , it should be one of the main priorities on our agenda , but it should be active too .
the second analogy , to the old balance - of - power system in europe , is especially popular among israeli and  |||  american  |||  diplomats .
( pl ) madam president , today one of the most important challenges facing the union is the creation of an effective mechanism for project coordination and information exchange  |||  among  |||  participants in afghanistan .
|||  although  |||  the islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post - arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction .
this is something we shall repeat  |||  again  |||  and again when we are in malaysia and the asean states , and the european parliament will underline this with this resolution .
furthermore , the european union and russia are currently negotiating a new contractual basis to replace the existing partnership and cooperation  |||  agreement  |||  .
|||  almost  |||  half of my customers bought avs device in order to ease sleep onset or improve quality of sleep .
the eu and russia are mutually interdependent , both economically and politically , and therefore , the conclusion of a strategic partnership  |||  agreement  |||  between the eu and the russian federation is particularly important for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners .
room service ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , currency exchange , bicycle rental , packed lunches , tour desk , fax / photocopying .
i would like also to come back to  |||  amendment  |||  138/46 and to make clear the meaning and scope of the text underpinning the agreement of parliament and of the council , the so - called ' last chance compromise ' .
the fact that we are essentially using research funds is totally  |||  acceptable  |||  , but it is absolutely right to seek new funding opportunities , for this project as well as for galileo for example , partly in the context of surplus budgeted funds , funds that have not been spent , and partly with new commitments by the individual member states .
it is very important that an ambitious and legally binding  |||  agreement  |||  on climate change is reached at the copenhagen conference .
|||  another  |||  very important point is the use of more rigorous training and certification measures for all interested and responsible parties in the community railway market , from railway companies to infrastructure managers .
thirdly , do you  |||  agree  |||  with my conclusion that without consent to significant reductions in emissions from the usa , china , russia and india , the efforts of the european union , and the costs we are incurring , will be wasted ?
offer is limited  |||  according  |||  our capacity .
the five executive  |||  agencies  |||  have 176 posts .
i am delighted that my  |||  amendments  |||  relating to the unacceptable effects of plant protection products that could , among other things , have a negative impact on the behaviour of certain species such as bees and that could even lead to the extinction of these species , have been taken into consideration .

i conclude by calling for greater efforts to be made by the commission and the council to circulate the european union  |||  annual  |||  report on human rights .
we wish you well but we hope that you will be the first to resist the tabloid frankenstein food mythology and put in place some policies that will  |||  allow  |||  our farmers to compete internationally on a level playing field .
the sudanese government 's consent to the deployment of the hybrid united nations /  |||  african  |||  union mission , which aims to keep peace in the region , is of course a welcome development .
|||  allow  |||  me also to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
|||  above  |||  all , they are entitled to have their data in the electronic communications space protected .
on behalf of the uen group . - mr president , once a beacon of hope , an example of african self - empowerment and a leader among  |||  african  |||  states , zimbabwe is now the epicentre of african despair and hopelessness .
this directive which has been  |||  adopted  |||  today by the vast majority of the european parliament marks an important stage in achieving greater consumer protection within the european union .
the draft  |||  agreement  |||  was examined by the committee on transport and tourism , which issued a favourable opinion .
as i understand it , the central system is now once  |||  again  |||  being shelved .
please  |||  allow  |||  me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied , but they also give prestige to our institutions : parliament , the council and the european commission .
we cannot , as commissioner rehn said in the foreign affairs committee , just kindly ask  |||  again  |||  .
this had to be admitted , albeit reluctantly , even by the  |||  advocates  |||  of the old european constitution .
russia probably can tame the iranian regime , but it will do so only in exchange for  |||  america  |||  's respect for its interests in the former soviet republics , and possibly also a revision of post - cold war strategic agreements .
this text will enable patients to seek treatment more easily in  |||  another  |||  member state .
i  |||  agree  |||  with you - and sadly we have proof - that missing children are often used for organ trafficking .
i voted against that  |||  agreement  |||  , which was blocked by parliament out of concern for the privacy rights of european citizens and companies , put at risk by unregulated bulk data - sharing arrangements .
i welcome the institutional  |||  agreement  |||  that was reached with regard to the implementation of the bonus initiative on 27 april last .
finally , if the initial proposals for social benefits to immigrants are reduced , as other groups have  |||  achieved  |||  in the voting in committee , then i think it is necessary , even though we are currently in a period of crisis , to ensure effective access to the labour market .
i must appeal to the authorities who fail to penalise this and even fail to  |||  address  |||  it , because cutting down forests has become common practice in the czech republic .
we did say at that particular time that we would keep the activities of credit rating agencies on watch , and in 2007 , when the subprime crisis reached its peak , i met with the credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  and expressed our dissatisfaction as to how we perceived they had conducted their affairs .
i think it a great shame that the council is not present , as i believe that this house has  |||  again  |||  taken a very clear position on cloning , and indeed considers that this has no place in the present regulation and should , at all events , be the subject of open and public debate .
|||  allow  |||  me to convey the appreciation of the council to the european parliament for the excellent cooperation .
with the conclusion of this  |||  additional  |||  protocol , the lisbon agreement can enter into force , 20 years after it was signed .
the variety of proposals clearly shows that we need broader debate on the activities of the european investment bank and the direction in which those  |||  activities  |||  should be developed .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on fisheries . - ( pt ) i must start by expressing my regret that the committee on regional development has not included any of the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled by the committee on fisheries on the fourth cohesion report .
faced with the budgetary restrictions affecting all countries , parliament will only  |||  agree  |||  to extend its assistance if eu funds have really served to improve the security of energy supply , modernise infrastructure and develop sustainable energy projects .
in writing . - ( fr ) the un security council is  |||  again  |||  going to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions on iran for its nuclear activities .
in the long run , the us and eu should support civil society organizations in pressing moldova 's government to guarantee more equitable distribution of television time , to stop police harassment of opposition political leaders and workers as well as journalists , to reform the police and end the ruling party 's abuse of state institutions , and to  |||  allow  |||  all political parties more opportunity to inspect election rolls and monitor polling stations .
the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) was created to provide  |||  additional  |||  support to workers who are suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns .
national and regional authorities must take  |||  advantage  |||  of these opportunities and make intensive use of the structural funds in order to boost employment , smes , the spirit of enterprise and work - related training , whilst making their contribution under the cofinancing rules , so that the allocated funds can be utilised in full .
let us wait for them , and  |||  action  |||  will be taken on this matter as it was on parental leave : this is the right way to go .
on  |||  amendment  |||  8 , i accept the inclusion of a reference to seal mortality as an example , and of considerations of climate change on cod when a review of the plan is made .
i should also like to draw your attention to the risk inherent in amendment 205 , which envisages labelling meat derived from  |||  animals  |||  that have been ritually slaughtered .
also ,  |||  amendments  |||  that remove the obligation for accurate record - keeping in the user establishment were not supported .
|||  airport  |||  shuttle , laundry , dry cleaning , breakfast in the room , bridal suite , bicycle rental , car rental , fax / photocopying .
france 's global  |||  ambition  |||  is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro .
( bg ) mr. chairman , colleagues , on the eve of the launch of the ratification of the lisbon treaty and the signing of the chater of fundamental rights , i would like to draw your attention to bulgaria and to the fact that , unfortunately , the bulgarian government , its  |||  administration  |||  and the reprsentatives of the ruling coalition in parliament are still far away from the application of some of the underlying fundamental principles .
is this  |||  acceptable  |||  ?
the european union wants to tackle this issue much more profoundly and so , this naturally takes account of the issues you raise , which are closely linked to  |||  action  |||  by the european union in relation to the fight against climate change .
however , according to a new report which we received in the committee on the environment last year , less than 2 % of cdm projects are in  |||  african  |||  countries .
the code of practice which we are voting on requires that young people should be guaranteed safe  |||  access  |||  to the internet .
it must not drift off course to become or inspire intergovernmental  |||  action  |||  .
as the honourable member mentioned , ministers for the various sectors often  |||  adopt  |||  domestic measures without previously agreeing on the objectives to be attained , so that decision - making is rather ad hoc and random .
but the subsequent recovery has been anemic and sub - par in most  |||  advanced  |||  economies given painful deleveraging .
this popular , family - run holiday hotel enjoys an idyllic and very quiet location  |||  above  |||  the village of wilderswil , with an wonderful view of the eiger , mönch and jungfrau mountains and of lake brienz .
if you look at what we agreed in the davies report and in the cars 21 report , where we  |||  actually  |||  want to start legislating in 2015 , the substance of the commission proposal has on the whole been safeguarded and there is a balance between social , ecological and economic criteria .
it has also become painfully clear that the member states are showing an ever - decreasing  |||  amount  |||  of solidarity when they have to contend with a crisis , and it is precisely european solidarity that is the first value to be lost when savings have to be made in national budgets .
the bush administration 's response to the hurricane confirmed the suspicion among blacks that , while they might send their boys to fight  |||  america  |||  's wars , they had not only been left behind in america 's prosperity , but that there was neither understanding nor concern when they needed it most .
then it was  |||  american  |||  troops and arms that liberated western europe from nazism .
there is also something quite new in  |||  advertising  |||  , which is not covered by the texts .
meanwhile , the proposal insists on increasing allocations for external  |||  action  |||  , to provide resources compatible with the eu 's ambitions .
moreover , the commission is also financing initiatives  |||  aimed  |||  at ensuring that darfurian society is involved in and committed to the process of conflict resolution .
however , we must ensure that eu - level  |||  action  |||  does not encroach on the principle of subsidiarity .
the opening of accession negotiations was  |||  agreed  |||  unanimously , and that means that france agreed to it as well .
ever since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year , the regime -- once central to american strategic interests in the region , has been made to feel dispensable by the us , which drops strong hints that there are  |||  alternatives  |||  to saudi military bases , even to saudi oil .
this would , in any case , send a positive signal as to our intention to take the measures necessary to address the important economic challenge  |||  ahead  |||  of us .
different sources of information are used to monitor and assess the compliance of operators with international safety standards ; namely , the safety audits carried out by the international civil aviation organisation , the information provided by competent authorities of third countries , the information provided by the european aviation safety agency in the framework of its inspections and investigations within the european union or technical missions outside the european union , the results of the ramp checks carried out on aircraft or air carriers at eu airports in the framework of the safety assessment of foreign aircraft programme ,  |||  according  |||  to the requirements of the relevant eu rules , and , finally , substantiated accident - related information stemming from accident or serious incident investigation reports .
there should certainly be clearer distinctions made between advertising and information , even though direct  |||  advertising  |||  of prescription drugs to consumers will remain prohibited under the relevant proposals .
the commission , too , had doubts about how long we would  |||  actually  |||  persevere with regard to the establishment of this new institution .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , shoe shine , packed lunches , fax / photocopying .
following the formal creation of the european  |||  agency  |||  for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union ( frontex ) , it has become necessary to make the best possible use of union border resources .
under the visa waiver programme , passengers travelling to the united states by air or sea will have to  |||  answer  |||  certain questions online before departure .
with this in mind , i am pleased to gather from mr belder 's most comprehensive report that there is constructive cooperation with the eu on the question of  |||  afghanistan  |||  in order to increase security and stability in this region .
thirdly , we believe it is important that , when other measures are taken in this region , whether these are  |||  additional  |||  car parks or other developments , a special screening of the entire project is carried out which includes existing developed areas and existing building projects .
certainly , according to sharon 's thinking , there is no future for 9,000 jewish settlers living  |||  among  |||  1.2 million palestinians in the gaza strip .
anwar 's bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement , as growing anti - umno and anti - mahathir sentiments took hold  |||  among  |||  islamic - minded malays .
many emerging markets have run current -  |||  account  |||  surpluses for the first time .
room service , meeting / banquet facilities ,  |||  airport  |||  shuttle , babysitting / child services , laundry , breakfast in the room , ironing service , currency exchange , packed lunches , car rental , fax / photocopying .
the fact that agreement was  |||  achieved  |||  at second reading is particularly gratifying .
however , the management of peugeot / citroen in mangualde currently wishes to destroy rights that were fought for and are enshrined in the labour laws by pressuring the workers to  |||  accept  |||  harmful conditions that endanger their lives .
it will be in the best position to take  |||  action  |||  since , rightly or wrongly , the americans are considered to have sided with the israelis , and the arabs , with the palestinians .
it is important to establish a level playing field for scientists from all eu member states , to provide equal payment for research  |||  activities  |||  , without dividing scientists according to their country 's standard of living , because scientific progress is a matter for the whole of the european union , not just individual countries .
meanwhile , vertical farm experiments -- which aim to augment urban food supplies by cultivating crops in skyscraper greenhouses -- are proliferating from the  |||  american  |||  midwest to osaka , japan .
europe 2020 must not trigger  |||  another  |||  competition marathon and privatisation exodus .

we need to be clear on this : human beings have a right to life from the moment the egg and the sperm fuse until their natural death , and this  |||  amendment  |||  fundamentally brings that right to life into question .
mr president , i would like to support the original  |||  amendment  |||  by my colleague , james elles , who has proposed a new paragraph which declares that the eu recognises the substantial contribution to the protection of the eu from long - range ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned deployment of the european - based us missile defence assets .

above all , the ' goal of a largely decarbonised transportation system by 2050 ' that is mentioned in the report , must involve significantly increasing development of various types of mass and public transport and promoting their use to make them  |||  accessible  |||  to all ; electric vehicles must be strongly represented in this process .
it should be noted that , as a general rule , democracy , governance and human rights are no longer taboo , and many  |||  african  |||  countries have embarked on the road to progress , as they say , not in response to europe 's expectations , but in response to the expectations of their own people .
i welcome the  |||  agreement  |||  reached on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council concerning statistics on pesticides which will allow for the creation of a legal framework and the establishment of harmonised rules for the collection and dissemination of statistics on the sale and use of pesticides , with a view to the sustainable use of the latter .

we are negotiating an  |||  agreement  |||  in which the subject of energy is essential ; these negotiations are beginning , and we have the best prospects for them , but obviously , like all agreements , it is something that depends on very complex negotiations that are , in turn , part of a series of negotiations on this cooperation agreement that we want to update - as i said - because a great deal has happened in europe in the past 15 or 20 years .
the europe that inspired the work and thinking of the founding fathers , not a europe of bureaucracy , very often and in my view almost  |||  always  |||  , deaf to the voice from the real economy .

the free movement of goods or a reduced customs duty  |||  allow  |||  a greater flow of capital and facilitate cooperation agreements .
that is the plea i make : that europe should  |||  again  |||  turn more of its attention to these countries .
in austria , we have a saying , and it goes as follows : ' does something  |||  always  |||  have to happen before something happens ? '
i would stress the need for the russian authorities to respond to this attack using a legal and moderate means , and to  |||  allow  |||  the russian judicial system to operate freely and independently to try and sentence those responsible for the attack .

|||  although  |||  supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries , the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries , and rightly so .
i regard that as  |||  added  |||  value .
we have  |||  achieved  |||  great success in managing to give a clear expression of support for use of the community approach as the main form of cooperation within the mechanism .
this is apparent from the fact that , yet  |||  again  |||  , the council is absent from this very important debate , despite the fact that as the second arm of the budgetary authority , it should be concerned about what is happening to the taxpayers ' money , which it is responsible for managing and disbursing .
i propose that the future european medicinal web portal recently created by the pharmacovigilance directive be used as a central point to  |||  access  |||  information .

next , people called by the activists as witnesses are not being  |||  allowed  |||  to appear in court to testify and make it a fair trial .
the figure i stated earlier does not include all those who sit waiting to see what their fate may be , many of whom are  |||  actually  |||  innocent and have been denied the possibility of a fair trial .
we can achieve this through a ' european reflex ' , provided we mobilise community funds without bureaucratic delay ;  |||  adopt  |||  and enforce strict environmental legislation to protect forests and ecosystems ; establish an independent european rapid - response team ; and implement a european strategy to combat the impact of climate change .
i also  |||  agree  |||  with the effective application of a european rapid - intervention capability .

new negotiations began in january 2009 with the willing andean countries , namely columbia , ecuador and peru , in order to reach a multilateral free trade  |||  agreement  |||  .
in addition , the speed with which the  |||  amendments  |||  were announced seems to suggest that these will not be substantive revisions , but only cosmetic changes , and that is not acceptable by any standard .
therefore , in drawing up this proposal , we have tried to take into  |||  account  |||  industrial sensitivities in the eu , especially as regards textiles .
as something essential to social development and combating poverty , early years learning should be founded on the guarantee of a pre - school network that is public , free , high quality and  |||  accessible  |||  to all .
i believe that the schedule presented here by the commission is a good one , as it requires the industry to come to a voluntary  |||  agreement  |||  by april or be subject to technical legislation .
therefore , i think it is absolutely vital that all members of this parliament urge the commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that i mean proposals which would allow every region across europe that qualifies , to  |||  access  |||  structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future .
through the  |||  amendments  |||  tabled , we have called for education and vocational training plans to maintain and develop the expertise and skills required for spent fuel and radioactive waste management .
but an even greater problem is the fact that there is also still no  |||  agreement  |||  on whether unmik 's powers should be handed over to eulex .
|||  allow  |||  me to make a few short remarks .
we believe that the main objective of the european urban  |||  agenda  |||  is to serve the development and qualitative updating of the infrastructure and services in european cities .

moreover , this solution has been  |||  accepted  |||  by customs representatives associations , even though they have lost their monopoly in certain member states .
to achieve these goals , the g - 8 should set clear timetables for  |||  action  |||  , and transparent agreements on how to fund it .
he , a british citizen , was able to take  |||  advantage  |||  of the excellent health - care service in belgium .

i am voting for this report , which  |||  aims  |||  to reduce the protein deficit in the eu , and i hope that its recommendations , such as support for farmers intending to opt for protein crops and practice crop rotation , will be taken into account when the new cap is being drawn up .
so far , the recommendations  |||  adopted  |||  by the gfcm have been transposed into eu legislation on a provisional basis , by means of annual regulations on fishing possibilities .

i personally believe that if we guarantee temporary agency workers the same conditions enjoyed by workers from user companies , we are not only protecting temporary  |||  agency  |||  workers but , above all , local permanent staff .
in our  |||  amendments  |||  we have highlighted the importance of giving special consideration to remote and isolated regions .
if we look at what the europeans have actually already done in terms of an efficient climate policy for reducing co2 emissions , what has  |||  actually  |||  been achieved , the reduction targets we have set , the legislation in our climate package , none of that is sufficient to achieve the two - degree target that is constantly talked about .
we all think we know the history of europe and so it is perhaps uncomfortable to hear that the europe we know is  |||  actually  |||  only one part of europe , as norman davies - that great historian of europe - has so effectively shown .
the obligation to include  |||  among  |||  them the countries of central asia and mongolia appears comprehensible only as an effort to unite under one umbrella states regarded by the rapporteurs as places of similar geopolitical importance , presumably as potential platforms against russia and china .
that is  |||  another  |||  task for the commission .
this action plan will propose several areas of  |||  action  |||  to tackle the main challenges posed by this phenomenon , which affects unaccompanied minors arriving in the european union in different contexts , and will be guided by the best interests of the child .
it is precisely this kind of macho reasoning that led  |||  america  |||  to war in iraq in the first place .

i therefore urge you , prime - minister , to support the initiatives of the parliamentt and the european commission concerning free  |||  access  |||  to the labour market .
for example , malta , ireland and the united kingdom are requesting that pet dogs and cats be subject to  |||  additional  |||  examinations for ticks , which must also be certified in their animal passports .
i have two brief technical comments : on the question of publication , members have said and i too shall add that it is absolutely fair and absolutely right for the member states in which  |||  access  |||  to the internet is severely limited to be given the facility , alongside the general rule of electronic publication , of publication in the press for obvious social and financial reasons .
this report , and every other initiative on this issue , will have no value in the future unless all of us , especially those of us who are directly elected by the citizens of europe , highlight in every policy , in every pillar of our  |||  action  |||  , the priority and emphasis which we need to give to young people .
i therefore  |||  agree  |||  with the rapporteur 's proposal to strengthen the ' territorial cooperation ' objective by increasing the overall budget from 2.5 % to 7 % , adopting measures to simplify the implementation of programmes and creating european groupings of territorial cooperation ( egtcs ) , which are essential to the functioning of cross - border governance systems .
we also welcome the proposal on ' new skills for new jobs ' , and trust this really will link in with the climate change  |||  agenda  |||  , which also needs to look at new skills in old jobs , because most of the workforce have now passed the stage of formal education , making lifelong learning crucial .
the  |||  agency  |||  must inform the european parliament of the actions taken to improve the programming and monitoring of its contracts , in order to avoid , in future , the deficiencies reported by the court of auditors .
in such circumstances , the fight against terrorism and piracy should be based  |||  above  |||  all on the elimination of poverty and destitution by humanitarian aid to the poorest and facilitation of development .
in its conclusions last december , the council acknowledged the progress referred to by the commission and  |||  agreed  |||  to return to the matter in the next few months .
my original  |||  amendment  |||  to paragraph 87 aimed to confirm , rather than merely recognise , nato 's role as the bedrock for collective defence - a role which is not just ' still continuing ' but should be seen as the only option for the foreseeable future .
i am decidedly against the rapporteur 's approach , and also believe that to call for a change in the directive without the requisite  |||  analysis  |||  at member state level , particularly in those member states affected by the judgment of the european court of justice , is an unreasonable step taken for political ends .
the agreement takes  |||  account  |||  of the needs and conditions of the various regions of the community , which differ in terms of natural environment and climate .
however , please  |||  allow  |||  me to say that all of us in this chamber - all members of the european parliament , and i am sure this also includes the president of the commission and mr lópez garrido on behalf of the council - would like , once again , to express enormous solidarity with the greek nation .
i believe that we have taken the first correct step through our proposal to provide eur 2.6 billion in a first step , to raise the ceiling for the year 2009 for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by an  |||  amount  |||  of eur 2 billion , to lower the ceiling of heading 2 by the same amount , and to provide eur 600 million for rural development .
i trust that the  |||  adopted  |||  text will apply to all sectors and not just to agriculture .
the financing of such  |||  actions  |||  should also reflect this .
i would like to amend my vote on  |||  amendments  |||  13 and 14 - it should have been a minus not a plus .
|||  although  |||  critical to china 's goals of modernization and globalization , the internet threatens the political status quo .
( fr ) mr president , the rapporteur , mr corbett ,  |||  actually  |||  expressed his views , using offensive language , i might add , outside the constitutional affairs committee regarding the political family of which i am one of the representatives in this house ; this clearly gives rise to serious doubts as to his impartiality .
i voted to  |||  adopt  |||  this resolution , while also taking into account the further themes which will be dealt with after the pilot project has been assessed .
on march 18th five years ago , castro 's government cracked down on the varela project and other civil society initiatives rather than risk allowing a spark of democratic reform to spread  |||  across  |||  cuba as it had in the former soviet bloc . the seventy five prisoners of conscience locked up were dissidents , independent journalists , leaders from civil society , and librarians , who had dared to speak the truth openly about what life is like in cuba . even though four prisoners have recently been released , fifty five of the seventy five remain incarcerated in deplorable conditions . in general , the only reason that any of these prisoners were freed was because of how seriously their health had deteriorated .
moreover , parliament appreciates in this sense the improved procedure put in place by the commission , following parliament 's request for accelerating the release of grants ,  |||  aimed  |||  at presenting to the budgetary authority the commission 's assessment on the eligibility of an egf application together with the proposal to mobilise the fund and hopes that further improvements in the procedure will be reached in the framework of the upcoming reviews of the fund .
the  |||  above  |||  mentioned advantages do emerge after the payment of the one - time agio .
among other examples , it  |||  aims  |||  for greater liberalisation of health care , water distribution , education , cultural services , tourism or financial services .
germany 's welfare system effectively creates a minimum wage for the low skilled that is so far  |||  above  |||  the market price that it effectively prices such workers out of jobs .
indeed , while everyone knows that each eu member state has its own laws , legal traditions , and codes , here we have yet  |||  another  |||  assault by these fanatical euro - federalists , in the shape of their desire to create a ' european judicial culture ' .
what is on the table for the so - called reform of the stability and growth pact is no great answer ; once  |||  again  |||  , it is the lowest common denominator - the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon .
this was very promising since  |||  almost  |||  all packages build on this architecture without problems using the pristine debian sarge sources .
we do not want just fine words ; we want  |||  action  |||  , so that this summer we will not be mourning the victims of major ecological disasters .
as we see , we have  |||  achieved  |||  a broad consensus in favour .
in  |||  addition  |||  , consumer protection levels should not be impaired by the dismantling of barriers .
thus i am very glad that this text was  |||  agreed  |||  at first reading , since urgent progress must be made in this field .
i would like to add that this is also on  |||  account  |||  of social exclusion .
light pine - taiga is formed mainly by pinus sylvestris and is  |||  almost  |||  without herbal and bryophyte undergrowth .
|||  although  |||  it would be best if these options were adopted by the un security council , the eu itself can and must act to increase the costs to the sudanese government of its continued obstruction of aid deliveries and its delaying tactics on deployment of international peacekeepers .
this crisis was largely a result of  |||  america  |||  's effort to bolster an economy weakened by vastly increased inequality , through low interest rates and lax regulation ( both of which resulted in many people borrowing far beyond their means ) .
i also applaud this report for calling on the member states to  |||  adopt  |||  measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members , predominantly women , of all ages in caring for older and younger members , in the context of solidarity between generations .
for  |||  almost  |||  a year now , since the expiration of the original start treaty in december 2009 , no us inspectors have been on the ground in russia to verify the state of its nuclear arsenal .
i feel i have to mention  |||  amendment  |||  2 , which sharply criticises pope benedict xvi .
the contentious issue now is products from cloned animals , which i do not support personally , and the labelling of products from  |||  animals  |||  fed on genetically - modified foodstuffs .
( de ) mr president , i would like the end of this  |||  amendment  |||  to be reworded .
there is still enough room for future  |||  amendments  |||  and improvements .
me , when i捌i shrimp was  |||  always  |||  smiling .
|||  although  |||  the political priorities for 2009 have been set , it has not been possible to keep any of the priorities at such a level as to make it clear that they have been favoured financially .
the american  |||  administration  |||  made it clear that military intervention by turkey in northern iraq would not be tolerated .
the commission 's original proposal and the position  |||  adopted  |||  by the committee on the environment on emissions trading both lacked equilibrium , as they put european production in a position that made it hard to compete in global markets without any special climatic benefit .
the european union should act to ensure that  |||  access  |||  is comparable , especially in rural areas .
to this end it is also essential that baroness ashton - our high representative for foreign affairs - and the new european external  |||  action  |||  service work for these same equal rights ; for example , in order that the toolkit to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( lgbt ) people is also used in all non - european countries .
individual terrorists are difficult to identify and here we are discussing privacy laws and whether or not to  |||  adopt  |||  technologically more advanced measures .
as i mentioned previously , this report had come a long way before it was  |||  adopted  |||  unanimously by the committee on legal affairs on 17 december .
we have  |||  achieved  |||  a great deal together , i think .
and today , the commission  |||  adopted  |||  a communication on an eu framework for national roma integration strategies .
then , it will be up to local authorities to decide what is more suitable for them ,  |||  according  |||  to their own objectives and needs .
in a large number of areas where your report , mrs gacek , calls on the commission to act , the commission is already taking  |||  action  |||  to ensure that these rights are reinforced and extended .
at the request of the bureau , i will be in contact with the national ministries for foreign affairs of the countries of the members concerned to establish what  |||  action  |||  the judicial authorities in these countries intend to take .
i cannot let it be said , as i heard just now -  |||  although  |||  everyone was positive - that these would be pious hopes , good intentions , because i should , all the same , like to draw attention to what has already been accomplished .
( hu ) mr president , commissioner , i must say that this directive gives rise to serious concerns  |||  among  |||  the oil processing companies of central and eastern europe .
the  |||  agenda  |||  will be followed by three documents on broadband : firstly , broadband communication , which details the implementation of the agenda with respect to broadband ; secondly , the recommendation on new generation access ( nga ) , which aims to clarify the basis to encourage investment in high - speed internet ; and thirdly , the first radio spectrum policy programme , which will form the basis of the commission 's strategy to generate enough spectrum for wireless broadband .
these applications , which are largely based on the us gps system at present ,  |||  account  |||  for around 6 % of the eu 's total gdp .
i voted with conviction to  |||  adopt  |||  the legislative resolution , because it makes provision for the simplification of administrative formalities applicable to ships entering or exiting the ports of member states .
in  |||  addition  |||  to this , we need a land policy that provides guaranteed standards on land use that respect its balance , as well as safe building standards .
the  |||  added  |||  value is innovation , because that is what is lacking in comparison with the united states , japan and china .
i therefore want to stress the measures  |||  aimed  |||  at stimulating the birth rate , accompanied by appropriate policies on education and training and on solidarity between the generations , intended to halt the demographic decline of europe .
yet what appealed to the outside world was not  |||  always  |||  an asset in the rough and tumble of israeli politics .
therefore , and taking into  |||  account  |||  the importance of the information society , support is being given to the aid aimed at offering suitable universal broadband coverage at affordable prices to our citizens , and we request that attention is paid to the development of roaming prices in the telecommunications field in subsequent reports .
( es ) mr president , commissioner , a proposal that did not prosper two decades ago is once  |||  again  |||  the subject of discussion and debate due to the financial and economic crisis .
the report that we have voted on urges the turkish government to launch a political initiative  |||  aimed  |||  at finding a lasting settlement to the kurdish problem .
when would you like to stay at the novotel newcastle  |||  airport  |||  ?
however , we also need to  |||  address  |||  fundamental problems such as the falling birth rate among europe 's indigenous population by providing better incentives .
the price for  |||  american  |||  - style democracy , he wrote , was artistic mediocrity and public conformity .
i support the report reviewing the small business act as it  |||  aims  |||  to improve access to credit and access to the market for small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes ) .
ladies and gentlemen , the agreement on the supervision of credit rating  |||  agencies  |||  is an important step , and i , too , would like to thank you , mr gauzès , and , of course , those working alongside you , the committee chair , mrs bowles , as well as the shadow rapporteurs , mr klinz , mr giegold , mr pittella and mr fox .
for the first time since the kennedy  |||  administration  |||  , the us is one of the only liberal democracies in the world with a center - left government .
such amnesties would only perpetuate the  |||  activities  |||  of the criminal gangs that are engaged in illegal immigration and human trafficking .
while we should  |||  accept  |||  his challenge , we should also get our priorities right .
i must admit that parliament hoped for a much more ambitious  |||  agency  |||  .
as a decision - maker at an oil and gas company , your job is defined by a complicated mixture of realities : price volatility , the high costs and risks of working in geographically far - flung and challenging environments , difficult  |||  access  |||  to reserves , and the pressure to find more cost effective exploration and production techniques .
i therefore agree with most of the measures proposed : consumer information , restriction on television  |||  advertising  |||  , nutritional and health information on food labelling .
i hope that , under baroness ashton , the external  |||  action  |||  service will develop into a genuine european service that will represent citizens from all of our member states , women as well as men .
this readmission agreement is therefore a necessary complement to the adoption of the visa facilitation  |||  agreement  |||  reached with georgia , which would necessarily have to be accompanied by an improvement in the security conditions necessary to combat cross - border crime and illegal immigration .
i therefore agree that the european parliament should call on the commission and the member states to ensure that the media and  |||  advertising  |||  professionals guarantee respect for human dignity and make every effort to combat discrimination and any incitement to hatred based on sex , race , ethnic origin , age , religious or other beliefs , sexual orientation , disability and social status .
similarly , i cannot  |||  accept  |||  amendment 10 regarding traps , since the proposal does not include measures to address this issue .
the detroit incident has shown that there is present danger , that the threat persists and , therefore , the member states must not  |||  allow  |||  that continuing flow of financial data to the tftp to be abandoned .
furthermore , in this context , we will specifically carry out the macro - economic and micro - economic analysis which forms part of this basel  |||  agreement  |||  , and you and your colleagues will naturally be informed about it , mr karas .
they can continue with their money ,  |||  although  |||  they are not producing cotton in the future .
( pt ) the barcelona process exists only because a series of central european policy issues are  |||  affected  |||  by our relationship with the south .
this virtual monopoly on information and its financing allows him to dominate , control and direct not only the majority of the audiovisual press and publishing media , but also their content , to his sole  |||  advantage  |||  .
the aim of this policy is to do away with physical , administrative and regulatory obstacles to cohesion , and to reduce the ' border effect ' between territories and regions in order to enable them to  |||  address  |||  their shared challenges together , whether those challenges are territorial ( services , infrastructure , urban and regional planning ) , global ( globalisation , climate change ) , economic or societal .
in relation to the  |||  above  |||  , i think the sanchez - schmid report on a challenge for territorial cooperation - the future agenda for cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation is an important contribution to work on regional policy , and i voted in favour of its adoption .
the most important element of the compromise reached relates to the effective separation - and i stress the word ' effective ' - of production and supply  |||  activities  |||  , on the one hand , from network operations , on the other .
for the time being , i regret to say that  |||  although  |||  the eu has shown leadership in a number of areas , where financing is concerned we are still not in a position to put the figures that will be required on the table .
i have pleasure in informing you that this year we again sponsored a resolution on intolerance based on religion or belief which was  |||  adopted  |||  by consensus in the un third committee .
according to the media ,  |||  afghan  |||  soldiers are lucky if they earn usd 20 .
the report does not state the fundamental fact that , in the eight years before israel , in its own defence , took  |||  action  |||  in the gaza strip , thousands of rockets were fired at innocent israeli citizens .
once again , parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the european globalisation  |||  adjustment  |||  fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations .
to accomplish this , a follow - up conference to the bonn  |||  agreement  |||  is also required .
first , all political parties agree that welfare - state arrangements should remain tax - financed ,  |||  although  |||  possibly with a stronger application of insurance principles in the social insurance systems .
in  |||  addition  |||  , it is not clear what it takes for a substance to be declared so hazardous that it has to be banned completely .
i think that the reference to ' hidden ' advertising mechanisms that have developed on the internet and are now in use there is appropriate ; in many cases the  |||  advertising  |||  is disguised as opinions or comments on social networking sites , forums or blogs .
it is noted that by adopting a decision to waive the member 's immunity , the european parliament is  |||  allowing  |||  the competent national authority to hold the person accountable ( given that there is no interference with the functioning and independence of the institution ) and by no means does this decision confirm the member 's guilt or express an opinion as to whether certain actions or views justify investigation .
once  |||  again  |||  we can see that the foundations of russian democracy are very weak .
agriculture is , and will continue to be , directly affected by climate change , because it involves living organisms and its outcomes are influenced ,  |||  above  |||  all , by the quality of the soil , water and air .
but to measure weight , is  |||  among  |||  the most lightweight and thin .
for the  |||  above  |||  reasons , i voted in favour of this resolution approving the conclusion of the agreement .

the next item is the report by luciana sbarbati , on behalf of the committee on petitions , on the  |||  annual  |||  report on the european ombudsman 's activities in 2006 .
let us not forget that the fund was created to provide  |||  additional  |||  support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in the global business sector , and after 1 may 2009 , also to those made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis .
( fr ) madam president , the eradication of poverty is  |||  actually  |||  a millennium development goal , but it is also a european objective in europe .
i believe that it would therefore be better to finally  |||  acknowledge  |||  the need to follow the path outlined but not followed , rather than to try to make a final effort to achieve in two years what we did not manage to achieve in eight .
in addition to the lack of an adequate civilian and security presence to reassure every community of its safety , the overall lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created  |||  additional  |||  tension .
if we content ourselves with words  |||  alone  |||  , however , the aggressor may strike again .
i have been advised that the precedent is as follows : where there is an oral  |||  amendment  |||  to an oral amendment , if the first person who tabled the oral amendment accepts the second oral amendment as a consensus , it is taken into account .
the proposal , which is a consolidated text  |||  agreed  |||  upon with the council and the commission , broadens the definition of trafficking , bearing in mind that the forms and trends are changing .
as i said , the commission is monitoring the situation  |||  according  |||  to the rules of eu competition law , and if there is a need for steps to be taken , they will be taken independently when the moment is right , when we conclude that action needs to be taken .
frankly , the first version was promising , in terms both of its  |||  analysis  |||  of the causes of the crisis and of many of the proposals for overcoming it .
we are trying to take practical , pragmatic  |||  action  |||  to assist part of the afghan population .
the regulation  |||  adopted  |||  in 2009 simplifies the provisions of the single payment system , thereby improving the effectiveness of the 2003 cap reform .
the eu will need a great deal more integration , perhaps until it becomes a centralised mega - state , before it is likely to operate a grand foreign policy and military strategy in the conventional  |||  american  |||  sense .
( de ) madam president , development aid is  |||  always  |||  costly , often unfortunately ineffective and sometimes even harmful , because it all too frequently does not deal with the specific problems of the country in question .
however , it is not  |||  always  |||  evident when people and parties stand for election what they are going to do if they win .
cultural  |||  activities  |||  are a vital source of enrichment for children by promoting intercultural dialogue .

|||  american  |||  arguments against russian cooperation center on iran 's motives for developing nuclear power .
there is no reason for it : there is an  |||  adequate  |||  parliament building in brussels .
i am very pleased to see that , with the rare exceptions who have  |||  admitted  |||  their obvious ignorance of the situation in the balkan countries , the vast majority of this house agrees that it is time we supported the tearing down of visa walls in the western balkans .
on the other hand , the integrated approach means also the need for integrating different sectoral policies both at the eu and member state level , which  |||  affect  |||  the development of all our territories .
|||  although  |||  health policy remains ( for the most part ) a national responsibility , we meps have a duty to encourage our member states to continue their efforts to reduce socio - economic inequalities , thereby also reducing disparities in healthcare .
' whereas the european parliament shall not  |||  accept  |||  double standards ; whereas , in order to put political pressure on journalists disclosing corruption cases linked to high - ranking officials and ruling party politicians , the government administration in hungary has recently introduced steps to launch criminal proceedings against such members of the media ; ' - namely mr tamás pindroch , the journalist from the magyar hírlap - ' whereas bearing in mind in particular that criminal proceedings were launched against the journalist who was investigating the scandals of a high - ranking former member of the government and one of the candidates for european commissioner ; whereas this has resulted in an atmosphere where the press is under political pressure in hungary ' .
the $ 82 billion " emergency supplemental " bill to finance american military operations in iraq and  |||  afghanistan  |||  leaves the united states spending more money on military power than is needed on a yearly basis to permit every child in the world to receive , within one decade , both primaryandsecondary education .
i should like to refer to  |||  another  |||  specific point , namely transport , for it is important that we should succeed in securing the inclusion of transport in the post - kyoto agreement .
the exchange rate is a safety valve : when an economy becomes uncompetitive -- say , if international demand for its products declines , or domestic costs rise  |||  above  |||  other countries -- a decline in the currency 's value can restore demand for the nation 's output , and so help preserve employment .
this technical  |||  amendment  |||  will simplify the management of revenue - generating projects where possible , by limiting the administrative burden in accordance with the principle of proportionality .

while acknowledging that the final text adopted today in strasbourg is less negative than the text that was previously  |||  agreed  |||  in parliamentary committee , the imposition of this charge will still become a reality and will mean an increase in existing costs for the outlying countries of the eu .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although we are dealing with it at a late hour , i believe that what we have here is an important argument that should be highly valued , because the therapeutic use of stem cells from the umbilical cord should be upheld , just as initiatives and information campaigns  |||  aimed  |||  at making the possibility of donating stem cells more widespread should be encouraged and promoted at every level , all the more so at the european level .
it must be hard and require enormous effort to acquire the unique skills that mark the superstar and earn societies ' respect and  |||  admiration  |||  .
the fundamental shape of the common agricultural policy for the years 2007-2013 that was  |||  adopted  |||  by the ministers of agriculture of the eu countries on 26 june 2003 in luxembourg includes some solutions that benefit poland .

what is needed in this area , therefore , is support for  |||  alternative  |||  sources of income , especially the development of tourism and the associated infrastructure .
i also hope -  |||  although  |||  mr rehn has already begun to make proposals - that the second lesson that we learn from all this is that we need to introduce a number of structural reforms , namely a preventive chapter in the stability and growth pact - which mr rehn has proposed - a european monetary fund , a structural mechanism that can be used straight away and , thirdly , a 2020 strategy that is far more robust than the strategy that is down on paper today .
i also voted in favour of  |||  amendment  |||  12 which , in order to ensure adequate funding for rural development programmes , maintains that greater flexibility should be introduced to enable the use , within the same member state , of unspent resources from the structural funds for this purpose .
it is probably time that we chopped our way out of the undergrowth in the establishment of this european external  |||  action  |||  service and that the eu was heard again in the outside world .
i support the commission 's proposal and the own - initiative report , but i would point out , once  |||  again  |||  , that , on this issue , rapid and uniform implementation is crucial .
